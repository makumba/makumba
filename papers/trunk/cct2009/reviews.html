The section that is supposed to discuss this definition is section 6 which is short (and far shorter than 4 and 5) and doesn&apos;t give a concrete answer beyond &quot;continuity&quot;. As a reader I&apos;d like to take away some lessons or design implications, but I can&apos;t find any that are transferrable beyond this specific case.<br><br>Sustainability is inherently connected to purpose and user motivation. These questions are not being discussed adequately. Why are users using the system? Why do they keep using it?<br><br>The authors also conclude at the very end that &quot;other professional principles must be enforced to ensure long-term sustainability&quot; - acknowledging that technology design per se and on its own may be necessary but not sufficient to achieve sustainability. That&apos;s been the credo of every single C&amp;T conference. Yet the paper focusses on technology design without devoting sufficient attention to these &quot;other principles&quot;.<br><br>The Introduction starts abruptly with web access statistics. Despite the fact that traffic figures would have been more illustrative in this case, I suggest to start with some background information. What intranet are we talking about? What does it do, what is its purpose? The reader doesn&apos;t find out until much later, and is lost until then.<br><br>It would have been great to add some screenshots so the reader can see the interface.<br><br>Section 3, Methods, 2nd paragraph: I&apos;m surprised that this is described as an issue. I suggest the authors have a look at the Action Research literature to back up their methodology rationale, especially &apos;ethnographic action research&apos;, and &apos;action research and participatory design&apos;.<br><br>Sections 4 and 5 did not contribute to the research momentum of the paper. These two sections felt like they were taken out of a textbook that teaches us about these concepts, rather than to report on the research at hand. The paper could do with a summary version of 4 and 5, and expand 6.<br><br>I did not understand the references to the Makumba party on pages 5 and 9.<br><br>The data of Table 1 is contained in Figure 1, so Table 1 may not be needed.<br /><br /><hr /><a name="paprev268"></a><table cellspacing="0px" width="100%"><tr><td align="left"><b>Reviewer 2 Comments</b></td><td align="right"><a href="#top">top</a></td></tr></table><br /><b>Comments for Authors:</b><br />This paper seeks to answer the question: what makes an online community – especially one made up of amateurs -- sustainable? It relies on a CoP lens and maintains that it is the sustainability of the practice that makes a community sustainable.  Relying on LPP, the authors further theorize that practice is made sustainable by designing a learning path. In the case of the Makumba programming community, this learning path takes the form of an architectural design that is relatively simple but capable of becoming more complex.  <br><br>Strengths 
-	an interesting case study; presented clearly and with rich data
-	the paper is well-written and clearly argued for the most part
-	paper addresses an important research question, i.e., sustainability of online CoPs
-	reliance on theory, i.e., LPP, to guide the data collection and analysis<br><br>Weaknesses
-	The paper is not clear on what “the practice” is that is being made sustainable. At a high level, the practice seems to be programming, but this belies the complexity of the learning path (made up of different learning/program modules), the sandbox, the need to refactor the code, and the rules associated with code.  In other words, it seems that there are multiple practices -- and multiple dimensions to practice -- that make up the community’s programming activity. I would like to see the authors discuss the concept of practice much more critically, both theoretically and empirically.
-	Furthermore, I’d like to see more justification for the focus on practice rather than participants and participation in the discussion around the source of sustainability. It seems a little too simplistic to focus on practice alone, especially when a lot of the data used to demonstrate the community’s sustainability includes people and their skills.
-	While I appreciate that the authors want to focus on the technical aspects of the Makumba platform and language rather than on the social aspects of the community, I believe that the paper is overly biased towards the technical.  What is not clear, for instance, is what the social/community practices are that ensure that community members follow the learning path as envisaged by the designers.  For instance, there is little explanation around how the sandbox gets used. Furthermore, issues of motivation are not incorporated into the sustainability of the practice.  Given the authors’ role as founders in the Makumba community, I suspect that their perspective on this case is overly biased and one-sided, despite their effort to collect additional data. I would therefore recommend a more complete treatment of events.
-	I did not see the need for the very elaborate discussion of radio amateurs.  A more succinct treatment of the amateur community would have left more room to discuss the theory of practice. 
-	The authors seem to pay little attention to the fact that in 2008 there is a shift in patterns both wrt the size of the intranet (fewer LOC etc) and the membership (smaller in all groups except Core BL).  Are the two pattern changes related? Has the need to refactor and simplify the code led to reduced participation?  It seems to me that 2008 could be a powerful test of the authors’ assumptions regarding the community’s sustainability.<br /><br /><hr /><a name="paprev295"></a><table cellspacing="0px" width="100%"><tr><td align="left"><b>Reviewer 3 Comments</b></td><td align="right"><a href="#top">top</a></td></tr></table><br /><b>Comments for Authors:</b><br />This paper describes the development of a student tech organization that is both a community of practice and community of amateur programmers. The main question addressed by proposal is to explain the sustainability of this amateur community of programmers called Makumba, an European wide student organization. This case study illustrates how particular design features of Makumba and recruitment and member introduction practices contributed to the sustained development of the system. This is a comprehensive account but some of the presentation is incomplete. For instance, define “Makumba” from the outset—it’s the leading word in the title of your paper but never is mentioned until the middle of the Introduction. There are also other vague descriptions such as “European-wide organization” that need to be far more detailed than this. Also later in discussion, Lave &amp; Wenger never talk about core forms of participation – the movement is always from peripheral to fuller forms of participation; there is no core.<br /><br /><hr /><a name="paprev362"></a><table cellspacing="0px" width="100%"><tr><td align="left"><b>Reviewer 4 Comments</b></td><td align="right"><a href="#top">top</a></td></tr></table><br /><b>Comments for Authors:</b><br />to examine a volunteer online collaboration is a valuable contribution<br><br>&quot;participant observation&quot; -- would you consider using instead &quot;involved observation&quot; -- since presumably you were interested in success in this organization and not neutral --  as per:<br><br>Kenneth Clark, Dark Ghetto: Dilemmas of Social Power. Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1989.<br><br>where you say &quot;We further suggest that technologies should be associated with community traditions, rituals and specicities.&quot; although I feel you are onto something, I cannot find where your data says this.  can you elaborate?<br><br>Makumba is a term you do not define, i.e. it is used for a variety of religious practices, out of respect for this, can you include a definition please?  If you are going to use the subhead, it is also needed.  But is this subhead warranted, do you make a case for it in article/<br><br>can you identify the organization and discuss it in context a bit?  are there other similar, how does it compare?  or does it have to be anonymous?<br /><br /><hr /><a name="committee_comments"></a><table width="100%"><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left: 0px"><b>Committee comments to authors:</b></td><td align="right"><a href="#top">top</a></td></tr></table><blockquote>None</blockquote></div></form><div class="footer"><table border="0px" cellpadding="0px" cellspacing="0px" width="100%"><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" width="33%"><a href="http://cct2009.ist.psu.edu/">Conference Website</a></td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="33%">This site uses<br /><a href='http://www.linklings.com' target='_blank'> Linklings software </a></td><td align="center" valign="middle" width="33%"><a href="?args=rJUHtGPCf40zU3b0bfPzTrA%3DxGPCf40zU3b0bfPzTHQP0A%3DxfGzU3ACIIfb0HQP0A%3DxfTz0Cx0zfsGRRNTtUb%3DsfGb%3DsfNM_TzY%3D40QHHGdbUfTtUbb0XfQbG9MMcTzY%3D40b%3DQxGdbUfTzY%3D40I%3Dx%3DGdbUfTA%3DxGzUyyfzIC%3DHz">Contact us</a></td></tr></table></div><a name="bottom"></a></td></tr></table></body></html>
