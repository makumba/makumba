% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.1SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.1SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file

% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,

% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide

\begin{abstract}
We address the issue of sustainability of practice, which we regard as crucial for the sustainability of the community at large. In the absence of material reward, sustaining a specialized activity such as programming is not a trivial matter especially when members move often in and out of the community. Our case is the group of voluntary, amateur programmers from a European-wide student organization. We present this setting as an Amateur Community and as a Community of Practice, and show how such framing help in understanding sustainability of practice. Although being totally voluntary and managing a large intranet, the group has been thriving for over ten years. To explain such high practice sustainability we examine the role of the technology framework used by the group, which was designed together with its members nine years ago. We then propose a more general framework for understanding practice sustainability in the context of amateur communities of practice.

%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
\section{Acknowledgments}\label{sec:acknowledgments}
Thanks to the students, members and associates of the Tech Committee who have worked hard to overcome Makumba imperfections and to make the Intranet what it is today, while also taking time to answer our surveys.  Thanks are also due to all the non-BEST Makumba contributors.  Anonymous1 and Anonymous2 have supervised this work with good advice during the crucial Makumba design phases.
