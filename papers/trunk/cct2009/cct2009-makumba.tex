\begin{abstract}
We address the issue of sustainability of practice, which we regard as crucial for the sustainability of the community at large. In the absence of material reward, sustaining a specialized activity such as programming is not trivial especially when members move often in and out of the community. Our case is the group of voluntary, amateur student programmers from a European-wide student organization. We present this setting as an Amateur Community and as a Community of Practice, and show how such framing helps in understanding sustainability of practice. Although being totally voluntary and managing a large intranet, the group has been thriving for over ten years. To explain such high practice sustainability we examine the role of the technology framework used by the group, which was designed together with its members nine years ago. We then propose a more general framework for understanding practice sustainability in the context of amateur communities of practice.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The Intranet of an European-wide organization had just over 600 dynamic pages at its launch in 2002. The Intranet grew steadily in both size and functionality and at the end of 2008 it has almost 2000 dynamic pages. Throughout, except for a few glitches, the system was highly available and fast. Today the Intranet has around 2000 users from among the organization members, and its public part can be accessed by 4000-5000 organization customers at a time.

Such figures would not be surprising for a professional international organization, which hires or outsources professional programmers and system administrators. 
The figures are however unusual for a voluntary student organization, whose IT crew (referred to as the Tech Committee) is made of amateur voluntary student programmers who often do not study Computer Science or related subjects, or are at the early stages of their education.  
Since 2002, the Tech Committee had over 10 active members at any given time, and the Intranet was extended with more and more subsystems even if about one third of the Tech Committee membership was renewed each year. Reflection on this {\it sustainability} is the subject matter of this paper. We further assert that the design of the technology used to build the Intranet, called Makumba, is a determining factor in the Tech Committee sustainability.
Prior to Makumba introduction, the student organization had disparate IT systems, and the Tech Committee was formed in 1997 to maintain them but had much lower membership counts and was highly dependent on a few people.

In this paper we aim to characterize {\it sustainability of practice and community} based on this positive experience. We also aim to discuss the role of technology in achieving such sustainability, and to draw design implications that would help to devise technologies that encourage sustainability. 

While we recognize the importance of {\it environmental sustainability} in IT and interaction design \cite{blevis07}, we focus on a topic that is only abstractly related, yet we believe important in community and technology research. It is e.g. common knowledge that most virtual communities are "either young or dead" \cite{pargman05}, and various cookbooks for making the community thrive were produced \cite{goodwin94}. Even for non-virtual communities such as our student organization and its Tech Committee, it is sometimes difficult to sustain a specialized activity within the community, and this issue was raised under the name of sustainability in the field of Participatory Design (PD), e.g. as a basic principle of a PD method \cite{kensing98} or as a call for "self-sustaining [PD] processes within work settings" \cite{clement93}.  While managerial aspects such as leadership and incentives for work are certainly important in sustaining an activity, we also advocate a focus on the methods and tools used in such specialized activities, as them being easy to learn or entertaining to use should lead to better sustainability of the respective practice. As immediately apparent liabilities to practice sustainability one can exemplify lack of material rewards, or frequent changes in community membership, both of which affect voluntary student organizations. A related useful notion is {\it self-sustainability}, whereby a specialized activity such as PD \cite{clement93} or programming is started by professional intervention in the setting, yet it is able to continue using only community resources (human and otherwise), after the specialized professionals leave the setting. In our case both types of activity were initiated in the student organization  by the first author as a Human-Compute Interaction researcher and computer engineer, who left the setting in 2003. The programming activity and its sustainability are addressed in this paper.

In what follows, we will frame the Tech Committee as a Community of Practice \cite{lave_wenger91, wenger98} and as an Amateur Community \cite{bogdan03, bogdan_bowers07}. We will then introduce the topic of practice sustainability, highly related to learning and essential for community sustainability. We present the student organization's Intranet and the Makumba technology that powers it, then we describe in detail the sustainable evolution of the Intranet and the Tech Committee, as it comes out from examining the source code repositories and Tech Committee membership lists. We then present the results of several surveys 
%TODO: maybe just one survey?
that we used to elicit data on Makumba learning aspects in general and sustainability especially. We then discuss our results with a focus on learning, sustainability and design implications for technology.

%TODO maybe mention the dialog between authors if we manage to have it

\section{Setting}\label{sec:setting}
The student organization running the Intranet of our interest was grounded in 1988 and is currently present in 79 mainly technical universities across 30 European countries. The organization grew from being present in 60 universities in 2003, and has at the moment about 2,500 members. Their aim is to organize {\it complementary education} in the form of courses and competitions for students of the member universities (i.e. not just for its members), to assist them with {\it career support}, and to foster the educational involvement of students through organizing symposia and workshops on different aspects of engineering education in Europe.
% TODO please add aims/details
The organization maintains contact with and raises funds from the European Union bodies and from a number of company partners. Internally, the organization has two statutory meetings per year and several less formal, smaller meetings in between. While most members only worked on international topics during such meetings, and for the rest they worked in their local organization chapters, since 1997 the organization was able to sustain "committees" on several topics: marketing, fund-raising, training and internal education, information technologies (the Tech Committee), and complementary education program management. The committees met in the international meetings but kept on working on their topic also in between meetings, employing e-mail and instant messaging systems, as well as dedicated tools as part of the Intranet.

The Intranet is supporting the activities of the student organization. It was assembled as an integrated system in 2002 from several systems. The {\it first} such system was an event application system for complementary education courses. The system registered student applications to the course events, and let the organization manage their acceptance (to one event out of maximum three applied for) and participation. The system had been re-built yearly since around 1993 to different levels of completeness, including several years when it failed to work and the members had to resort to manual management. The application system was based on e-mail for communication initially, and a Web-based system was devised in 1995, built using the C programming language. The system finally 'stabilized' as a Java software which was re-used for several annual editions of the complementary education program starting in 1997. This system was helping the management of the most important student organization activity and was heavily dependent on the first author until its Makumba re-implementation was completed in 2002.

The {\it second} system was an internal document archive and member profile management system known as the "Private Area". The system started as a set of manually maintained Web pages, keeping documents produced and voted upon in international meetings, and it was automated using Lotus Notes in 1998, when internal event management was added to facilitate member application to and participation in statutory meetings and other internal events. At the time, a need for a common technology for the IT systems of the organization was recognized and Lotus Notes was intended to be that technology. However its shortcomings for the Tech Committee context were recognized and the Makumba technology was designed in response.

{\it Third} a "virtual jobfair" was built as part of the 'career support' organization mission,  allowing companies to post job adverts, and students to post their profiles. This system was among the first coordinated implementation efforts of the Tech Committee, as different from the previous spontaneous implementation endeavors by individual members. Several technologies were tried out, starting in 1997 with Lotus Notes, continuing with Java Servlet technology before the system was finally launched in 2000, using an incipient Makumba version.
% TODO, I think it was 2000, not sure how important this is, it was mostly unused for many years
% rudi: i think it was later, I'll try to dig it out

Besides heavily extending and integrating the above subsystems, several Intranet features were added since its inception: a Wiki, email archives for the organization's over 500 mailing lists, a training database, a survey-engine, a career-newletter, and a unique sign-in system that allowed students to share their accounts between the "Private Area", the course application system and the "virtual jobfair". Further, a number of team support tools were implemented, like project and task management for both international committees and local chapters, company relations management for both the fund-raising committee and the local chapters, and several specific tools for the committees, often in the form of statistical analysis of student account data, subscription to the newsletters, etc. Another major new tool is an online voting system, intended to make the statutory meetings less crowded.
%TODO more here, it feels like little was done since 2002 :)
% rudi: still not enough? :-) i can still offer: teacher access to Johnny & possibility to share materials there,;IRC chat in PA; major improvements in document archives, events management; university project (university profiles & offers on the public site); PROP aka pr-ordering pages aka a web-shop for posters & materials; an FTP storage for LBGs, integrated in PA as applet & jsp pages viewing the data, based on PA accounts; several tools for LBGs to fetch data for their local webpages;

The Tech Committee is in charge of developing and maintaining the Intranet, as well as supporting it with activities such as helpdesk. The committee also coordinates activities of interaction design for further new areas of the Intranet. Administration of the Intranet, as well as of communication systems such as e-mail are also Tech Committee tasks. There are two formal membership levels ("trainee" and "active member") and there is a formal coordinator, elected each year, who is also a member of the student organization overall coordination bodies. In its early (less sustainable) days, the Tech Committee consisted of 1-5 members who were mainly responsible for the individual systems and had difficulties backing each other up when they did not have time for voluntary commitment. This is similar to the present day situation of IT bodies from other student organizations in Europe and Canada who have approached the Tech Committee for know-how, or technology transfer. Tech Committee membership levels increased after 2002, and new members are usually attracted in international meetings with a three-hour Makumba training, including exercises in making dynamic pages that browse Intranet data in various ways, improving existing Intranet pages, followed by assignment of more complex Intranet-related tasks.
% TODO more about the training, or after it: are they given Intranet tasks? Do they do Intranet-based exercises to change some interface or browse some Intranet data?
% rudi: in the training, they normally don't do intranet related tasks, they do completely new pages. they start from a given MDD, and then do the full range: list, object, newForm, and then for the more advanced ones also editForm, deleteLink, mak:count() & co.
% TODO rudi: not clear here, do you just want to describe the recruiting, or also the first path in ITC

\section{Methods}\label{sec:method}
We regard sustainability as a long-term matter that cannot be investigated with a short focused study. Throughout our contact with and involvement in the Tech Committee we were concerned with sustainability and at times we considered theoretical frameworks and recipes for how to achieve it, thus sustainability was an ever-present research issue for us, but also a practical issue in the community life. Both authors were active in the Tech Committee at different times (1997-2003 and 2004-2008 respectively), and {\it participant observation} was a conscious investigation approach for the first author, who also designed the Makumba technology together with Tech Committee members in a conscious act of {\it cooperative design} \cite{greenbaum_kyng91}. This paper is the occasion for a {\it reflection exercise} \cite{schon83}, on the part of the second author. Sustainability being a long-term issue, we expect other writings about it to be reflective accounts. 

We are highly aware that our first-hand involvement with the Tech Committee is a potential hinder for us producing an 'objective' account of its sustainability and on other matters of interest, and this is probably not uncommon in community-related research endeavors. We therefore complemented our personal experiences with both non-elicited and elicited data, as described below. Furthermore, our involvement having taken place {\it at different times} has resulted in a fruitful confrontation process that allowed us to depart from our personal opinions and arrive at more reliable and valid results.
%TODO more about dialog between authors
%TODO: rudi: here I'd add that we have seen a bit how it goes in other organizations, namely AEGEE, IAESTE, CFES, and to some extent bonding, though they have different settings with loads of meetings

For assessing quantitatively and qualitatively the sustainability of the Tech Committee and its practice, we regard as non-elicited data the {\it code repository} that the community has maintained, which allowed us to assess and reflect upon the progress of the Tech Committee work. The repository uses the Concurrent Versioning Systems (CVS) technology, which allows us to examine the incremental changes and additions that were made to the code, their time, and their authors. We are thus able to reconstitute the Intranet code as it was at any moment in time since 2003. A number of code analysis tools are also available for investigating CVS repositories, and we found them useful for our inquiry.

We have also elicited data from the Tech Committee members, for purposes related to the Makumba technology. In 2002 the first author evaluated the design of Makumba with a questionnaire that had 12 respondents. In 2005 the first author also ran a questionnaire with 32 respondents to asses the status of Tech Committee work and technology use, and thus indirectly look at its sustainability. Finally, both authors designed a questionnaire at the end of 2008 where 30 out of the 45 past (since 2003) and present members who were approached reflected on their activity in the Tech Committee over their whole 1-4 year-long membership period. This questionnaire provides this paper with both quantitative and qualitative data.

% makumba 2008: http://private.best.eu.org/survey/admin/listAnswers.jsp?survey=cwu9pab

During our membership we had access to the e-mail traffic and other communication of the Tech Committee. A further form of non-elicited data is constituted by Tech Committee {\it membership lists} at different times during the committee activity since 2002. Such lists can be made by examining member profiles in the Intranet. Number of members, as well as their level of activity are useful indicators in assessing sustainability. Therefore the membership lists were complemented with levels of member activity as elicited from committee leaders and self-assessed by members themselves in questionnaires. Personal acquaintance with many of the members and knowledge of their skill evolution has come to complement this further. Some members continued on an IT career after graduation, and this was yet another indicator of their IT skills. 

To be able to better comment on our data, we will go through some conceptualizations of learning, community, practice, amateur and voluntary work, and sustainability. We will also describe in more detail the design of Makumba.

\section{Community of Practice}\label{sec:cop}
Patterns of learning in the Tech Committee, as well as in the other committees and in the student organization at large, are well described by the Community of Practice social theory of learning  \cite{lave_wenger91, wenger98}. This learning perspective captures the social, informal and everyday aspects of learning, and emphasizes the community aspect of learning, i.e. members learn as part of and the ways of belonging to a community. This is referred to as "learning the ropes" or more formally "learning in doing".  As community members learn, they evolve from peripheral participants to 'full' community members, i.e. full participants. At first, they want, try, then pretend to be members, then they identify with the community and finally they become expert members. 
In effect this is a description of the social relations between newcomers and old timers, and of the individual acquiring of knowledge and skill. The process of becoming a full participant "configures" learning in doing.

This theory captures accurately the kinds of learning processes taking place in voluntary settings, where there is little incentive for attending elaborate formal education or resources for providing it. Instead, learning takes place while doing and participating, informally.
Practice is not all informal however, it is slowly reified \cite{wenger98} to canonical forms such as books of rules and regulations, training and other formal learning arrangements and material, etc. 

The Community of Practice perspective was extracted from field studies in five settings ranging from midwives to tailors and non-drinking alcoholics \cite{lave_wenger91}, but it of course applies well beyond, e.g. in insurance claim sorting \cite{wenger98}. Many programming-related activities and their 'learning/membership paths' covered by the community members are well-described by the theory, for example MUD community members becoming magicians (MUD programmers) \cite{pargman00, pargman05}, open source contributors becoming 'committers' i.e. earning the rights to commit new code to the open source project repository. It is worth noting that in both cases a formal, canonical member role has been reified out of existing practice, in a similar distinction to the trainee--full member reified in the Tech Committee.
% TODO: Rudi:  open source contributors ? i.e. you mean people that are already coding, but need to send their code to someone to check it? or you mean users of open source libraries, etc.. ?

\section{Amateur Community}\label{sec:amateur}
A further conceptualization that encompasses work in voluntary communities such as the Tech Committee, or other student groups, is the Amateur Community \cite{bogdan03, bogdan_bowers07}. The perspective was extracted from studies of Amateur Radio (ham) \cite{bogdan_bowers07} and has been tentatively applied also to open source and other programming related communities \cite{bogdan03}. 

The term 'amateur' is often used in a pejorative sense in everyday speech to denote 'novice', 'unprofessional', 'bad approach to work' or 'bad quality of work' . However, upon close examination of people who talk of themselves as being "amateur", authors have encountered that the skills of e.g. amateur mycologists \cite{fine98}, actors, baseball players and archaeologists \cite{stebbins79} range from novice-level to an expertise that rivals their professional counterparts. Sciences like astronomy still depend on the work of amateurs for their progress. Amateurs carry out their activities primarily out of their love (French "aimer") for the activities themselves, as different from paid (or otherwise rewarded) work activities such as jobs. An ethnographic account of various amateur settings \cite{stebbins79} describes amateurs as being socially situated "on the margin between work and leisure"; amateurs often describe their activity as work, and they rarely pursue it alone. Relevant social categories for amateurs are the \textit{professionals} of the activity that they pursue (e.g. professional radio operators for hams) which they draw influence from and sometimes exercise influence towards, and the \textit{public} towards which they relate in doing their work an benefit from it (e.g. the public at large in case of a disaster where amateur radio communication can be of help). This is referred to the Professional-Amateur-Public system. In relation to the professionals, amateurs can be professionals of their trade at the same time (e.g. hams who have jobs in the radio domain), or they may aspire to become professionals, in which case they are referred to as \textit{pre-professional}, or they have been professionals of the domain and presently continue it as amateurs (\textit{post-professionals}).

Within the Amateur Community perspective, amateur work is mainly driven by \textit{challenge}, which generally originates in \textit{contingencies} that need to be negotiated during the activity \cite{bogdan_bowers07}. Unlike professional work where contingency is often not welcome, and expensive to address (yet capacity to address it is regarded as competence), in amateur work contingencies of a specific kind are almost requisite. Amateur radio work is hampered by contingencies related to weather (which affects radio propagation), the working state of the radio equipment, what other hams happen to be active at the same time on the same frequency, how far they happen to be, etc. Yet it is these contingencies that constitute the radio challenge, addressed with pleasure by the members. The challenge, and its constitutive contingencies are thus requisite but must be \textit{addressable}, i.e. there should be enough skill within  the amateur community to address the challenge. At the individual level, balancing a challenge with skill is regarded as essential for the psychology of the optimal experience \cite{csik90}. A healthy \textit{contingency space} will include contingencies addressable by experts or old-timers as well as by novices or newcomers. For example, a novice ham operator can try to work short-range VHF connections (used routinely by the public for e.g. taxi cab dispatching)  while experts can try to achieve long-range VHF connections, preferably with low emission power, which have no public utility due to their lack of reliability, but constitute a great radio challenge.  

Besides being addressable with various levels of skill, a contingency space should ideally be \textit{inexhaustible}. In the amateur radio example, the weather is likely to always provide radio-related contingencies. On the contrary, an amateur community whose members aim to travel to all points of integer geographical latitude and longitude (www.confluence.org) have a remarkable, yet exhaustible contingency space. For a further example (also illustrating the diversity of amateur settings), amateurs who aim to teach re-populated bird species to migrate again by leading their flight with light aircraft (www.operationmigration.org) have a virtually inexhaustible contingency space, as increasing the number of re-populated birds, possibly in new places, or focusing on further bird species are always valuable challenges.

A further Amateur Community work driver is the \textit{audience} \cite{bogdan03}. Challenge addressing, shows of mastery, are rarely kept for oneself. %TODO: doesn't sounds like a complete sentence..
Peers are normally expected to benefit from contingencies being negotiated, or members of the community \textit{public} will benefit. A notable form of community contribution is \textit{pioneering of new contingency spaces}.  For example ham operators who discovered new modes of radio propagation opened a whole new world for the rest of the amateur radio community, which other operators could chose to 'visit' or not, i.e. they could take the new challenge or just stay with the existing ones. Some such new forms of propagation were of direct benefit to the \textit{public}  (e.g. amplitude modulation) while others were only useful for the amateur community (e.g. connections achieved by sending a radio wave to the Moon which reflects it back to an Earth location where the other communication party is). Worth noting here is that challenge is \textit{socially constructed}, i.e. a new contingency space may be adopted by all or some community members, or it can be totally rejected as something that is not worth pursuing by the community.

\subsection{Amateur software development}\label{sec:amateur_devel}
It is useful to characterize amateur software development such as hackers \cite{levy94} or open source \cite{kollock99} as amateur communities 
because Tech Committee is a less professional (pre-professional) correspondent of such communities. 
In such communities, code challenges are hardly exhaustible, as programming a machine leads to a rich set of contingencies, bringing along lots of 'trial and error'. 
It is also easy to open new contingency spaces partly due to the immateriality of the working artifact, new projects, or project modules can always be started, or the existing ones can be re-organized ("refactored" in the professional jargon). For a newcomer, the complex architecture of large software projects adds to the challenge, and their skills of mastering the programming language will not be enough, they will also have to learn the way the project was organized.
Code is shared typically via plain text messages, and carefully examined before being committed to the code repository, which suggests another amateur community feature, related to the notion of audience, the \textit{peer review} of challenge addressing. 
Plain text is regarded as a very suitable medium for such distributed development and review efforts \cite{yamauchi00}. 
Another important part of the community audience is its public, which can be an important motivation factor: for very generic projects it may be the world at large (e.g. in the case of an open source operating system kernel, an office suite), or very specialized professionals and amateurs in the software development field (e.g. for an open source compiler suite).

\section{Sustainability of Practice in Amateur Communities}\label{sec:sust}
Based on the theoretical considerations made on Amateur Communities and Communities of Practice, we can now consider in more detail the issue of sustainability. First, practice being crucial to the community, sustainability of a community appears to be inextricably linked to the sustainability of its practice: a community will thrive if its practice can thrive. For that, in an amateur community, its challenges should not be easily exhaustible, yet they should also be addressable by newcomers. Furthermore, there should, at all times, exist interesting challenges for both newcomers and old-timers. In short, the features of "healthy contingency spaces" are essential ingredients for sustainability of practice in Amateur communities. But most of all, besides challenges to address, and skills to match them, there should exist enough members who take these challenges. A healthy, sustainable amateur community, will have enough members at all the milestones on "learning paths", i.e. at all the important learning thresholds on these paths.

\section{Makumba, the Tech Committee tool}\label{sec:makumba}

Makumba was designed with influences from Lotus Notes, but without the visual programming approach that was found to be troublesome in the distributed Tech Committee setting (cf. \cite{yamauchi00}). As another difference from Lotus Notes, Makumba was designed to offer as few features as possible to its user-programmers and this minimalsitic design was thought to facilitate learning. 

Makumba organizes a system in three parts. The \textit{Makumba Data Definition} (MDD) describes data structures and relations between them. MDDs are simple lists of data fields, with name and type. The \textit{JSP level} is technically a tag library for the Java Server Pages dynamic web page technology, which allows displaying and changing the data stored in a database and described in MDDs. Finally the \textit{business logic} (BL) describes, in the Java programming language (mostly its procedural features), "business rules" that restrict the changing of data, and provide authentication and authorization mechanisms. The JSP level, described in Listing 1, provides for a combination of HTML and a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language). The example shows a list of students and, for each student, their completed studies. The data for this list is described in the "Student" Makumba Data Definition (MDD). Notably the SQL data combinations (so-called joins) and data selections (so-called projections) are generated automatically from notations like "s.education" and "s.surname" respectively. Therefore reading a Makumba JSP would not require as much knowledge as using SQL by itself.

Through this design, the assumption was that it will be easy for students to read MDDs, and based on that, it will be possible for them to combine HTML and a subset of SQL (itself based on natural language) which they might know prior to start working with Makumba or might learn "on the job". Later on, they would become interested in writing new business rules, and might learn procedural Java for that, maybe using previous knowledge of another procedural programming language. This then would be the "learning path" assumed for a Makumba practitioner.

Initially Makumba was designed and developer under another, more neutral name ("Metadata"). When a more specific name was sought, designers remembered of a name that was well-known to many student organization members: the Makumba party. The name was known but not the actual meaning because members who had attended a Makumba party usually described it like below. Ironically, the main Makumba designer had never attended a Makumba party, but knowing about its existence and its fame within the organization was enough to decide on the name.

\end{table} 

Let us first illustrate the Tech Committee activity in what we perceive as its sustainable period. Table~\ref{tab:intranet-size} shows the evolution of the size of The Intranet since its launch seven years ago, detailed for the different technological levels MDD, JSP and BL. Additionally, the total number of code files is shown, along with the total lines of code (LOC).  Figure 1 shows the evolution of the code figures graphically. It is worth noting that there was a rather high amount of data definition (MDD) files defined in the beginning of The Intranet, representing data used in the first three sub-systems. Even though more data definitions have been added over time, a certain saturation level has been reached in the last years, with only minor additions. It is not unexpected that the data definitions of an organization (its "domain model") change seldom after an initial development time. 
As different from that, the amount of Business Logics files has continuously increased, with a leveling in the last year. This leveling, as well as a JSP number decrease are due to the Tech Committee finding the time to re-organize (refactor) their code without adding functionality, but simplifying it in the process, thereby allowing future members to understand it easier, and making it possible to implement more powerful features over the new, improved, code structure. Finding the time and resources for refactoring is itself a sign of sustainability.

Table~\ref{tab:itd-members} illustrates the number of active members in the Tech Committee since 2004, differentiated on the different levels of Makumba, and on their activity in newcomer (``peripheral'') and old-timer (``core'') members. This data was  extracted on the one hand from the latest questionnaire filled in by the members, and then refined and amended by some of the committee coordinators.  It is interesting to note that while the overall number of active members increased over the years and stabilized in the last years, the number of members active on data definitions (MDD) was rather decreasing; this might be explained with the above described arrival at data maturity level, and thus less work and challenges to take for the Tech Committee members, while plenty of challenge is left at other levels. An important sign of sustainability as we characterized it earlier is the sufficient number of members at both novice (peripheral) and expert (core) members active at all the Makumba usage levels at all times. The "learning paths" are thus well populated with community members.

\subsection{Survey}\label{sec:techCommittee-survey}
A survey was conducted among current and former members of the Tech Committee in the end of 2008, and filled out by 30 members. The time of Tech Committee membership ranges from their activity starting around 2001, to fresh members that just joined in the second half of 2008. Also the educational background is diverse -- 7 members study computer science or engineering, while 6 study informatics; the other respondents follow various other curricula, ranging from mechanical engineering to physics abd biomedical engineering. Also, the membership duration in the committee varies, from 6 members that were active for around four years, to members that were (or currently are) active for one to two years. Most members had no knowledge of Makumba before joining.

The questionaire consisted of 53 questions. The main focus was on gathering an understanding of the learning aspect of Makumba in the context of the Tech Committee, thus the participants were asked to answer several questions on their self-assessed skill level on database design, SQL, general programming, Java, and three aspects of Makumba: JSP pages to view data, JSP pages to create, edit, and delete data, and business logics (BL). The questions were asked repeatedly for several different points in time, namely when joining the committee, and after the first, second, third and fourth year of membership, and allowed answers from ``no skills'' over ``little knowledge'', ``some experience'' and ``experienced'' to ``master''. To balance the self-assessments and to facilitate recall, the participants were further asked to estimate their contribution to the committee in that year, and to list their projects and technologies the worked with in that year. Also to improve the quality of the self assessment, members were informed that the committee coordinators from their time of activity will review their answers.

Figure 2 shows the averaged skill levels of all the members at different points in time, separated for 3 Makumba usage aspects: JSP for viewing data, JSP for modifying data, and BL. It can be observed that apparently, learning to view and display data in JSP level than handling forms to create, edit, and delete data, while Business Logics are the most difficult concept, especially in the first two years of membership. Most members that stay in the committee for a longer period, however, master all levels of Makumba almost equally well, but that is not a case of challenge exhaustion as they can (and many do) continue working on the internals of Makumba itself  as a next step. While MDD editing skills are less and less actual, we can consider that currently the learning path milestones in the Tech Committee are: JSP viewing data, JSP changing data and BL. To further illustrate the member skill evolutions, we have selected the charts of four individual members in Figure 3. This also shows that, although the dynamics vary a lot, the JSP data-changing skills almost always lag behind the JSP data view skills, and BL skill is acquired last. 

Overall, the per-year self-assessment results suggest that the learning path designed into Makumba has achieved its goal, allowing for members to have an easy start by visualizing data in JSP, then starting to change data and finally learning how to write business rules in Java.

Two open questions concluded the questionaire. The first one aimed at getting impressions on how the members experience learning technologies in the Tech Committee. Many people cited ``learning by doing'' and by using already existing pages as a base to be adapted to their needs as major factors; moreover, many developers stated how helpful the Tech Committee is with providing assistance with code examples, via the mailing list or chat channels. TODO: mention here that this alleviates lack of groups/forums/.. on the web?

\begin{quotation}
 	% rudi: both things fit what was said in the discussion
 	"Learning by doing", "try and error" - the environment makes those two things possible, especially thanks to the ParaDe sandbox and the "linear" nature of Makumba/HTML. [..]\\
 	I would say that the code is very close to the result ("what you code is what you get"), or at least, very logically connected. 
\end{quotation}

% \begin{quotation}
% 	% rudi: true for every kind of technology, thus not relevant for makumba
% 	The current systems provide a lot of examples - this has 2 sides: helps when you learn from the good examples, and makes it worse when you use the bad code. 
% \end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	% rudi: shows easiness of learning makumba
	For me the greatest thing has been the first touch with coding using makumba: anybody is able to get a working page after 10 minutes of theory and 5 minutes of practice. That's provide motivation to do more difficult features.
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
% 	% rudi: community learning, but too focused on events. ? good that it's mentioned that HTML & SQL are not needed
	I didn't attend any organised Makumba training, but learned the basics during events, in the first year. It was quite easy, although I didn't even know HTML or SQL when joining ITC. 
	(On the first 1-2 projects, I was directly helped by ITC experienced members). Afterwards, I started following also the emails and learned a lot from other people's problems/experiences.	
\end{quotation}

% \begin{quotation}
%	% rudi: mentions only ITD
% 	I usually learn by reading code and trying to reform it in a way that suits what i want to do. ITD is good at this part, since all our code is available and it's easy to find a place that something similar was done before. 
% \end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	Learning is easy thanks to a lot of examples: for most of the tasks I could find another place where a similar feature had been implemented. Having a good knowledge about BEST IT systems helps more than having strong programming skills. Other ITD members also very often help and give advice when a problem or mistake occurs. 
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	% rudi: we don't actually have much documentation, but the statement seems otherwise well suited
	Learning technologies in ITD is really easy cause we have a lot of documentation and a lot of people around in the ML eager to help. When I had a doubt, sending a mail to the list was enough to have 20 answers to the question explaining what to do, why and how :) 
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
    % rudi: must keep
	Technology-wise, I love Makumba as how it's designed -- the whole way the view/controller separation is less sharp than in other frameworks, how this is made very accessible and maintainable using the Makumba tag library, and how in the end this makes a large intranet maintainable by a community of people of variable skills. 
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	% supports well that makumba teaches the separation of view & controller
	The ITD community is helpful, it is very easy to learn new technologies. I think makumba gives a very good starting point for learning web programming (separation of concerns, data model design). Everything that I learned in ITD has proved to be true also in the professional web development world. 
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	You get to learn new things both seeing what other do and by doing yourself. It is very easy to start doing things and see results very fast which is really motivating. 
\end{quotation}


The last question asked the respondents for a comparisons of Makumba with other technologies and frameworks aimed for web development.

\begin{quotation}
	% rudi: supports well that makumba is suited for non-IT people
	All the other frameworks and technologies I know (Struts, PHP + templating engine, Zope) require a higher degree of computer technologies knowledge to achieve similar results. This might be changing with new frameworks like Ruby on Rails in which the model definition is done in a similar way as in Makumba, but still I think Ruby on Rails' learning curve is steeper than Makumba's 
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	I can only compare with PHP: PHP to start with was easy, but to make sound applications, you needed to do much more coding 
\end{quotation}

% \begin{quotation}
% 	% rudi: a bit too confused
% 	I did some basic JSP page with a blog in a school course I had, where we used HTML and JSP and mySQL for the database. This required many lines of code for doing the database connection and stuff. This was much easier in Makumba, as you don't have to be get into all of this connection part and the database management in the same way. So having a solution like Makumba is much better for ITD where there is a bigger flow of students.
	%(Of course it requires someone that also can take care of what's happening inside makumba, and this requires more knowledge and skills to do. So for a good suitability in ITD it's also important that there are people around that knows makumba from the inside.)
% \end{quotation}

% \begin{quotation}
% 	Makumba seems to work relatively fast "out-of-the-box" - Its very fast in Makumba to copy-paste and adapt "similar pages" to what you need. basically, you need to exchange the names of the MDDs used.. 
% \end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	%I have not used any other frameworks apart from writing my first PHP page this month (I wish I could have rewritten the whole app in makumba :)).
	% rudi: must keep to support cristi's hypothesis
	Makumba still appears to me as having a very strong positioning, allowing to reach very quickly decent results with its basic features (allowing new joiners not to get tired of the learning effort and to contribute quickly) while also providing more powerful stuff for advanced users (allowing them to still find new challenges). 
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	% rudi: must keep, supports perfectly the discussion
	Mak is significantly more suitable for ITD than anything else I've seen, despite the horrible inflexibility of the J2EE platform. Most other frameworks/setups insist on a very clear separation between the model and the view, and in most situations, this makes sense. However, by moving certain typically controller-world operations, such as database queries, to the view \textbf{in a simple and accessible way}, pages become much more maintainable without very strong documentation discipline, because they somewhat self-document.
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	Makumba being specifically designed for web applications, it is both extremely simple to learn for the basics - easier than PHP, especially for non-programmers - mainly through the easy interactions with databases; yet can be as powerful as any other language. %, altough that involves dealing with Java, which is immediately more complicated - but not more complicated than any complex operation with any language.
	The main disadvantage is that everyone must learn it, since it is quite different from other web technologies. But the main advantage is that everyone \textit{can} learn, without too much of a technological background. I think that for ITC, or for any organization who wants to involve non-IT people in the development of their applications, the use of Makumba can make things much easier.
	% (provided that we keep having nerd masters to maintain and update it :p) 
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	% rudi: first sentence is a bit strong, but then it is quite suited, but too long
	Makumba is definitely the only technology suitable for BEST. I've been working a lot with trainees, teaching them the technology and about our systems, so after observing them it is quite clear that simplicity is the crucial aspect. Makumba is very easy to use and, with a bit of programming knowledge, BL is also quite accessible. One big advantage is the syntax, which makes it straight forward to understand other people's work. With Makumba, it doesn't happen so often that 2 people write totally different pieces of code for the same feature, and this is very useful for BEST (where people change very often). I would even say that, to some extent, Makumba is keeping me (and other people) in BEST. I would have never stayed so long in ITC, if it wasn't so easy and fun to learn Makumba. As well, the new features developed during the past year are so amazing, that it seems people are becoming active again just because they want to try them out! 
\end{quotation}

% \begin{quotation}
% 	Makumba is really easy to use compared to other technologies. The learning time is short and the possibilities given by the framework are great. It's really fast to program with it and really user friendly. 
% \end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	Makumba is great because it makes possible for non-IT people to write a webpage easily, with a little more knowledge than HTML
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
	% rudi: backs some of the conclusions, like the interdependence of files due to braking MVC
	atm. I can't think of frameworks that do mix view and model, i.e. view and data query. they all go through a DAO layer, which would break the "what you code is what you get"). other frameworks also do have a lot of configuration overhead and rely on Java, which make it difficult for beginners to grasp. e.g. Struts needs to have several files changed in order to get a form to work, which is not so straightforward and slows down the "try and error" process. 
\end{quotation}

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:disco}
We should first mention that we cannot deny the merits of the non-technological aspects of the Tech Committee work and organization that contributed to its sustainability: the managerial skills of its leaders and experienced members, or the well-organized mentoring of the newcomers, are all aspects that surely help sustaining the Tech Committee practice. However, our data (including explicit statements from members of different generations) shows that Makumba's learning-oriented design and the meanings associated with Makumba in the student community play a crucial role in the Tech Committee sustainability.

Our data show that designing a programming technology that allows member activity at various levels of skill, thereby prescribing a learning path for the members of the amateur community of practice, allows for sustainability of the amateur programming practice. In the case in point, we saw that the 'learning departments' of the setting, corresponding to the different programming languages used, were well populated at all times, in all our annual counts,  even if members left the setting every year while others joined. We can recommend as a design implication to design 'skill-modular' technologies, with 'modules' that require different levels of skill, with the first such module having a low learning threshold (HTML and simplified SQL-queries in the Makumba case), in order to provide for challenge addressability, and the next modules providing new challenge levels (e.g. BL in the Makumba case, with the procedural Java skill to be learned), thereby helping towards challenge inexhaustibility \cite{bogdan_bowers07}. Such learning modules with new challenges also provide for progressing from the periphery to the core, thus molding themselves well on Community of Practice social learning. The technology can then, as we believe Makumba does, be part of the \textit{configuration} process emphasized by Lave and Wenger \cite{lave_wenger91}. Especially for the entry-level skill modules (the JSP level of Makumba), \textit{code legibility} is an important design feature for an amateur programming technology, in such a context of learning in doing, from peers, or from the artifacts they produced. Most of our respondents mention looking at a working example when performing a task, and this is not unexpected in a Community of Practice. A major part of the Makumba JSP level simplicity and legibility is inherited from the corresponding feature of SQL queries, as legibility and intuitiveness were among its design principles, since it is based on natural language. Members who do not know SQL simply have to rely on their English to find their way around initially. This is further helped by Makumba JSP using a simplified form of SQL queries. Using plain text code rather than visual programming further helps the sharing and understanding of existing examples \cite{yamauchi00}. We will also emphasize here the importance of an \textit{amateur programming experimentation} (cf.  \cite{bogdan_bowers07} for experimentation with amateur radio equipment). Few programmers work on the actual 'officially running' system, instead they work on a copy of it running with some example data. The lower the skill available, the more important the space for experimentation becomes, as a space for making initial mistakes, trial and error, and low-risk attempts to find solutions. It is difficult to imagine what Makumba programming would have been without the Tech Committee members' sandbox.

We were however not satisfied when discussing our data that this theoretical 'skill modularity' picture captures the Tech Committee sustainability entirely.The first author, who proposed it, has never actually been active in the sustainable period of the Tech Committee, and has coded little of the the Makumba Intranet. It was the second author, along with former and present Tech Committee leaders during its sustainable days, who pointed out  several other aspects that lead to sustainability, some of which were confirmed by questionnaire respondents. First, the student organization regards Makumba as being something that \textit{belongs} to them. It is something that they give to the world therefore it is a way for them to relate to a \textit{public} \cite{stebbins79}, or a wide \textit{audience} \cite{bogdan03}, thereby increasing amateur motivation. Entering the Tech Committee gives one a privilege to work with a technology that is unique, and designed by previous Tech Committee generations. Entering the Tech Comittee also means being part of the team who had in 1995 an automated online application system at a time when many companies barely had a static website. While such an early achievement is not directly related to Makumba, it emphasizes the Tech Committee long-lasting tradition in the area of dynamic Web applications, Makumba's application domain, and is supplemented by other similar \textit{war stories} \cite{orr96} that have a role in learning, but also in creating a sense of belonging. Furthermore, entering the Tech Committee often means attending a Makumba party, one of these mysterious events that other people talked about but never wanted to give details. This reminds us of an \textit{initiation rite} \cite{vanGennep60} and plays a role in attracting new blood to the committee. In retrospect, choosing the Makumba name in favor of other, more technology-oriented but less student-community-oriented names was an inspired act. This teaches us that, while skill modularity has its merits, it can always use complementation from cultural meanings ascribed to the technology within the community: traditions, war stories, rituals, world-unique specificities. An implication then is to try to link the technology with community meaning. If this was possible to achieve (albeit somewhat accidentally) for such an intricate thing as a web development framework by a simple act of baptizing, it could work for many other technologies.

The relative uniqueness of Makumba to the student organization has an interesting consequence: since it is not a well-known technology, there are very few Tech Committee members who already know the technology when they join the committee, so they have to learn it when they join, at the same time as they come in contact with the traditions and rites associated with it. As there are not many resources dedicated to Makumba on the Internet, they have to resort to their fellow Tech Committee members, thus being 'forced into socialization', and thus fueling peer learning.

Reflection on Makumba as a technology for \textit{pre-professionals} \cite{stebbins79} leads us to two apparently contradictory considerations. On the one hand, Makumba imposes a professional rule, preventing the amateurs from mixing business rules with data views.  The two are programmed in very different languages, requiring different skills, and different skills levels, making  it difficult for the amateurs to even attempt to mix them. Many technologies in use by amateurs (like PHP) do not enforce this separation, leading to lack of \textit{code scaleability} of application development: applications can be started fast, like with Makumba, but once they grow large, problems start to occur due to not enforcing this major principle, affecting in the end sustainability. On the other hand, another professional rule, the separation of data view from data access is violated by Makumba, as emphasized by several former members, currently professionals. Ironically, the two rules are part of the same professional design pattern, the Model-View-Controller. \textit{Selecting relevant professional principles} is thus yet another design implication that we draw for amateur technology, and as the example shows, it can lead to fine-grained decisions. In other words, even if the professional counterpart is a potential role-model to be followed by the amateurs \cite{stebbins79}, not all its aspects will be useful in the amateur programming setting. We can draw a simple consequence of this implication: many professional technology designer use "more is better" as a principle in designing a feature set. In an amateur community, like it happened for the Tech Committee with Lotus Notes, members trying to employ such a technology would have a hard time choosing the feature they need. The small number of Makumba data types as well as the small amount of keywords in languages used (HTML, SQL-query) come to suggest that "more is better" is not a good professional principle to select, as it doesn't fit the amateur learning situation, where members need to get involved (and get some sense of achievement) fast. 

A further feature that we can recommend for amateur programming technologies, related to code legibility, is to provide for \textit{easy code navigation}.  As emphasized by some respondents, Makumba has fewer types of files than professional technologies in the same application domain, therefore requiring less navigation between files when performing a task. Although this sometimes breaks the professional principle of separation of concerns (like data access concern and data view concern, as illustrated above) it helps the novices to make easier progress, and achieve better orientation when contributing to a large project like the Intranet. Furthermore, this source file compactness, especially at the JSP level, leads to little interdependency between the JSP source files (i.e. changing one such file is not prone to affect the working of many others), which helps when several of amateur programmers work on different parts of the Intranet, as they are not prone to affect each other's work, and thus the likely mistakes that a novice makes will not affect his or her peers. Such \textit{team scaleability} is ideal for amateur programming sustainability.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
We have described the sustainability of an amateur programming group, and examined it as an Amateur Community and as a Community of Practice. Based on this framework and on data collected over several years, we proposed several technology design implications for achieving sustainable practice in communities. We suggest that technologies should be learning-oriented, more precisely they should be organized around skill modules. We further suggest that technologies should be associated with community traditions, rituals and specificities. Finally, we suggest that a careful selection must be done from among the principles used within professional counterpart of the amateur community. Such a selection should also be made with learning in mind: professional principles can be broken at the expense of easier learning, yet other professional principles must be enforced to ensure long-term sustainability.
