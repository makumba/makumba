* Form submission message also shown for successful response
* Fixing bug in MDD parser that would prevent overriding of IDD fields in sub-tables (setComplex, ptrOne)
* Enhancing analysis engine: reporting invalid values for tag attributes can now be handled through AnalysableTag#registerAttributeValues()
* Improving error reporting: when an error occurs during the analysis or execution of a tag, we fetch the exact line of that tag and display it to the user.
* Keeping the analysis status in the servlet context (as attribute) until the error does not occur anymore, so that we can keep on displaying the error message on successive requests (page reloads).
* Extending/refactoring page analysis: introducing AnalysableElement and ElementData to abstract from Tag, and allow for another kind of element (EL expression).
* Moving all the code required for accurate error handling into AnalysableElement
* Small fixes reported by bug detection plugin
* Fixing small bug in error viewer: removing generation of a link to the current directory in error pages when encountering a '.'
