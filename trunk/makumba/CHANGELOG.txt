0.9.0.2 21 Jul 2010

FIXES
manu: throwing a ConfigurationException in MakumbaJSPFactory when the controller filter is not mapped or does not apply (instead of a NPE)
manu: copying fix from RecordParser in findDataDefinitionOrDirectory method of MDDProvider, should fix some bugs in developer tools relying on this behavior

FIXES
manu: fixing release mechanism broken due to build path change

rudi: several fixes in the data object viewer servlet: charEnum and setIntEnum don't cause errors anymore, displaying ptrOne and setComplex, allowing to view ptrOne and setComplex details
rudi/cristi: fixing type computation for case-when, especially when there was no else part
rudi/cristi: some date fields (maybe those resulting from function calls) returned a byte-array, treating that in TableManager
manu: date now accepted as field name in antlr MDD parser, also fields starting with low... accepted (by incresing lexer lookahead to avoid collision with 'lower' keyword)
manu: fix in DataDefinitionImpl affecting the order of consecutive self-referring sets in getFieldNames()
manu: improving checkValue so that it throws an exception when a Long value is bigger than the maximal value an Integer can take. fixes #1071
manu: check for number of arguments to single-field validation rules, fixes #1239
manu: better error message for impossible composite update/insert, fixes #656

manu: improving error reporting: when an error occurs during the analysis or execution of a tag, we fetch the exact line of that tag and display it to the user.
      we keep the analysis status in the servlet context (as attribute) until the error does not occur anymore, so that we can keep on displaying
      the error message on successive requests (page reloads).

implemented some makumba functions: mak:count(), mak:maxCount(), mak:lastCount()

0.5.11.2; 15 aug 2004 cristi
support for the standar servlet authentication mechanism (bug 663)
the support is as follows: 
- the users and roles can be configured in the servlet container (e.g. Tomcat)
- security constraints limiting some parts of the site to some users and roles can be declared in the webapp descriptor (web.xml)
- if the value of the R attribute is requested (e.g. via $R or via mak:attribute) 
and R is not present in the HTTP session, 
and the standard servlet authentication indicates that there is a user U logged in and has the role R, 
- then the value U is returned. 
BL checkAttributes() can use Attributes.setAttribute() to transform the String attribute U into a pointer, or anything else.
- otherwise, the old mechanism is used to search for R (in the page attributes, in findR() BL method, in the HTTP parameters)
so the old login mechanism is still supported but the standard servlet mechanism (if used) takes precedence.

0.5.11.1; 30 jul 2004 cristi
support for Attributes.setAttribute()

adler; 16 jun 2004: fixed bug 103: reduce upload memory
cristi; 10 jun 2004: fixed bug 699, pages executed without controller (e.g. from 404 handler) lead to infinite recursion

- addForms can add to the subsets of object produced by the enclosing newForm.
- any number of levels of form inclusion is possible but only the outermost form can have an action, onSubmit, and method and other attributes specific to HTML forms. 
- all form actions take place in a single transaction, which is rolled back by the controller filter if there is an error. 
- after_ methods are not executed in correct order (bug 689)

----------------------------------------------
| 2003-01-08 - CVS repository lost due to HDD failure.    
| reconstructed all sources, but lost history, hence lover revision numbers
----------------------------------------------

0.5.5.17; 6 jan 2003 cristi
better ways of buiding jars, without interfering with ../../util-java/lib

better util.longContent logging level and documentation (too little change for a new version)

0.5.5.16; 9 dec 2002 cristi
added the path info to login form action to make login work in the pages that use path info in the URL, e.g. /archive/doc/xx-yy

0.5.5.15; 6 dec 2002 cristi
added a small servlet so parade can set the logging root at webapp runtime.
some more meaningful cache names

makumba registers the loading time for applications to know it

0.5.5.10; 27 nov 2002 cristi
refactored to expose the OQL analyzer and remove dependencies between packages

0.5.5.9; 26 nov 2002 cristi

0.5.5.8; 20 nov 2002 cristi
simpler AttributeParametrizer (will need rewrite anyway)
autoReconnect=true is default now (to address bug 139)
minor bug fixed in RecordManager (guards against DBConnectionWrapper class cast exception)

0.5.5.1; 6 nov 2002 cristi
fixed deletion of objects coming from another db

0.5.6.1; 6 jan 2003 cristi
- refactored the forms further, only the jsptaglib1-dependent features are now left in org.makumba.view.jsptaglib, the rest of the stuff is in form responders, org.makumba.controller
action
- while refactoring, i got more acquainted to the jsptaglib code, especially forms, so there are more features...
- <mak:action> is now added and documented to support complex form actions that include makumba tags
- infrastructure for multiple forms is now in place, and runs ok in the 'particular' case of the simple form. 

0.5.6; 17 dec 2002 cristi
- the need for "first makumba tag" is eliminated for login and form response
- now anything can be a response or can request login, including plain HTTPs or JPGs. that also means that all separate (non-include) accesses (e.g. images) are authenticated!
- as excpected, authentication is only done once, included JSPs are not authenticated
- some tag classes moved (login, logout, response) so tomcat/work/Standalone/localhost/context_name will have to be deleted before working with this version
- quite a lot of the form response code moved from org.makumba.view.jsptaglib to org.makumba.controller.http, org.makumba.controller.html, org.makumba.controller.jsp. that should make the taglib rewrite easier.

0.5.5; 3 nov 2002
cristi: joined the 0.5.4 branch with the main branch

stefan: fixed bug 75

cristi: work on build.xml
- added the tagJar target, which tags a version from the current checked out branch, but doesn't publish it, just places it in util-java/lib
- added makeJar which compiles and jars any version of makumba and places it in util-java/lib
- deleted target dist2, put jsptaglib2 in another branch and use tagJar instead
- added description to main targets

0.5.3.22; 23 mar 2002 stefan
added manifest.mf file to the distribution jar

0.5.3.21; 20 mar 2002 cristi
fixed a design flaw: the text swapping code was allocating 32k for each text, no matter how small. due to that, database copies needed huge memory. every other code that uses texts was affected, due to CPU-hungry memory allocation efforts.

0.5.3.20; 19 mar 2002 stefan
cristi: pageContext.findAttribute(pageContext.EXCEPTION) should return a reason for exception (if specified in logic). instead of 
mak:response for login forms

0.5.3.19; 14 mar 2002 stefan
lowercase generated delete link html tag 
integer html tag parameters in quotes (size, rows, cols...) in FieldFormatter

0.5.3.14; 6 mar 2002 cristi

fixed bug in NullableValueStrategy, more precise determination of the enclosing query status before repetition
LongData is now fully used in long page swapping

0.5.3.8; 5 feb 2002 cristi
made all long texts swap to disk. swapping of the pages uses the same code.

requiredAttributes() replaced by checkAttributes(Attributes, Database) in the business logic

UnauthenticatedException (wrong username/password) was separated from UnauthorizedException (good authentication but no access to a resource) are now separated, but both produce a login screen

a more general catch() ensures catching more errors in the business logic.

db reconnection message more clear 

toto: improved org.makumba.util.NameCase

0.5.3.7 3 feb 2002, stefan

fixed bug: tag parameters "lineSeparator" and longLineLength produced NPE in org.makumba.view.FieldFormatter#checkParams (tnx Stefan)

fixed a bug that was not displaying some <mak:object> bodies at first page run
files in the servlet context are now linked by the source viewers

0.5.3 18 jan 2002, cristi
fixed bugs related to checking values (for int, charEnum). tnx Stefan, Jesus, Janez.

devel: source file paths are printed in canonical form now (no more \..\ )

design change: mak:attriute sets the attribute to null if exceptionVar is present

mak:input can now have both a dataType and an internal declared type. their compatibilty is computed. before, if both were present, an error was shown.

since representing set int{ ...}  and set char {...} as separate set is not convenient at presentaion level, they were updated to work again
- specification update, removed their deprecation
- at database level, they can now be updated with Vectors (similar to sets to foreign types)
- OQL was modified to interpret a "lonely" label of type setint or setchar as the set member (rather than a pointer to the record where the member is kept) 
- presentation level (org.makumba.view.jsptaglib.set*EnumEditor)

bugfix: files included in login.jsp are not asked for login, to avoid infinite loops (tnx Priit)

groupBy is not inherited to inner mak:list anymore (tnx Fred)
