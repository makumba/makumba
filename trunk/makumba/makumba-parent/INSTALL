INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

- install maven (http://maven.apache.org/download.html)

== eclipse set-up

- install m2eclipse (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e/)
- install m2eclipse-extras (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e-extras/)
  - only install the "Project configurators for some commonly used maven plugins" (and the "Maven Integration for WTP", if you want to use it in other projects)
- go to the eclipse maven preferences (Window->Preferences->Maven) and:
  - in "Installations", add your maven installation instead of the embedded one (http://www.sonatype.com/books/m2eclipse-book/reference/eclipse-sect-maven-preferences.html)
  - in "Maven" (main view) add the following goals for the fields "Goals to run on project import" and "Goals to run when updating the project configuration":
    process-resources process-test-resources
- go to Window->Preference->Validators and select "Suspend all validators" (or remove the validators you don't want to use, e.g. JSP, HTML, ...)
- create empty makumba and makhib mysql test databases in mysql; on linux, you can use the "setup-mysql-db.sh" script
- checkout the project, either through command-line or directly through File->New->Maven project from SCM (untested).
  In the latter case, you don't need to re-import it again (skip the following step)
- go to File->Import->Existing maven projects and select the makumba project directory.
- if needed, configure makumba-parent/build.properties
  - this is important especially when releasing, where you need to have the makumba-documentation project checked out somewhere
    in order to generate documented TLDs

In order to run the test webapp:
- with jetty: go to makumba/etc/eclipse-launchers, right click on jetty-mak.launch and select Run As -> jetty-mak
- with tomcat: go to makumba/etc/eclipse-launchers, right click on tomcat-mak.launch and select Run As -> tomcat-mak


(TODO: instructions on how to import the code formatting & cleanup templates)

== IntelliJ IDEA set-up

- create empty makumba and makhib mysql test databases in mysql; on linux, you can use the "setup-mysql-db.sh" script
- check out the project, don't let it be imported right away
- if needed, configure build.properties
- create a new project from the maven model based on the sources you checked out (select the makumba-parent directory)
