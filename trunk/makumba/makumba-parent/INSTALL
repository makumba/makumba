INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

- install maven (http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
- create empty makumba and makhib mysql test databases in mysql; on linux, you can use the "setup-mysql-db.sh" script

== eclipse set-up (works with Kepler)  (see IntellJ below)
(TODO: instructions on how to import the code formatting & cleanup templates)

1) Prepare eclipse for maven
   =========================
- install Subversive plugin
- install m2eclipse
http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/download/
including antlr and subversive connectors

2) Prepare & checkout makumba  (https://svn.code.sf.net/p/makumba/code/trunk/makumba/)
   ==========================
- File/Import/Checkout maven project from SCM, choose SCM type svn
(if you don't have the svn connector, click on "M2E narketplace" link at the low right, install also the antlr connector if you miss it)

- from the URI above import makumba, makumba-core, makumba-shared-resources, makumba-jsp-test

- you will get two kinds of errors. Choose quick-fix / "ignore in Eclipse"
for 3 projects: Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.codehaus.mojo:properties-maven-plugin:1.0-alpha-2:read-project-properties
for makumba-core: Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2:java 

- rename the makumba Eclipse project to makumba-parent if it is not renamed already

- due to the errors above, you need to compile outside eclipse first. in Terminal, cd to makumba-parent and execute
mvn clean integration-test
- refresh makumba-core and makumba-jsp-test

Now you should be able to work in Eclipse on makumba-core and have other projects depend on makumba-core, including web projects like karamba (see below)
What will probably not work is TLD changes, as well as changes in makumba-shared-resources/target/maven-archiver/pom.properties.
If such changes are needed, execute again mvn clean integration-test, then refresh the makumba-core and makumba-jsp-test

- if needed, configure makumba-parent/build.properties
  - this is important especially when releasing, where you need to have the makumba-documentation project checked out somewhere
    in order to generate documented TLDs

3) Use makumba-core with a WTP project 
   ===================================

To run web projects that depend on your makumba checkout
- install eclipse WTP
http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/juno/
- from the servers view, configure a tomcat server
- in order to use makumba directly as a dependency in a WTP project, go to the project properties->Deployment Assembly->Add->Project and add the makumba-core maven project
- run the project on the tomcat server using Run As

3) Run/debug makumba tests inside eclipse 
   ====================================

There is a "mvn tomcat7" launcher in makumba-parent/etc. Start that first, then you can start JSP tests like ListOQLTest, FormOQLTest, etc. 

To make your own launchers:
- right-click on makumba-jsp-test and go to Run As -> Maven build...
- in the Goals field, enter 'tomcat7:run' (recommended) 'tomcat6:run' or jetty:run'. Note that only Jetty supports hot-redeploy in this set-up.
- right-click on a test class like ListOQLTest and choose Run As/Junit test. Note that you will have to add on the Run configuration the VM argument 
-Dcactus.contextURL=http://localhost:8080/tests




== IntelliJ IDEA set-up

- check out the project, don't let it be imported right away
- if needed, configure build.properties
- create a new project from the maven model based on the sources you checked out (select the makumba-parent directory)
