  <p>
    An input field to be created, depending on the makumba type of the field.
</p>
  <p>Set and pointer inputs will render as select boxes. Sometimes you may need to use two select boxes whereby the user
    can
    move items from one box to the other, which is illustrated in this example.</p>

  <p>Date inputs are slightly different than normal inputs, as they are rendered with several input fields (for the day,
    month,
    year, hours, minutes and second, depending on the date/time format). Additionally, a JavaScript-based calendar
    widget can be used, as shown in an example.</p>
  <p>
    The difference between &lt;mak:input&gt; and normal HTML &lt;input&gt; in a makumba form are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>&lt;mak:input&gt; produces objects prepared for setting/comparing makumba fields (e.g. Pointer, Date, Text).</li>
    <li>the fields produced by &lt;input&gt; will be available as page $attributes but will all be of type String</li>
    <li>the fields produced by &lt;mak:input&gt; are available separately as a Dictionary to the handler method</li>
  </ul>
