This file describes the visible changes due to refactoring, that can have an impact outside of Makumba (for users).

- in web.xml: the NamedResourcesContextListener is not anymore in util package but commons
OR simply remove it as it is declared already in the TLDs

- in org.makumba.MakumbaSystem:
  - close() inlined
  - getMakumbaLogger() inlined
  - getDefaultDatabaseName deprecated, use getDefaultDataSource instead

- org.makumba.abstr moved into org.makumba.providers.datadefinition.makumba
  
 - possible behavioural changes (needs testing): 
  
  - in GenericMakumbaTag: we don't treatException anymore (in treatException) but just throw a RuntimeWrappedException
  - in ResponseTag: we don't treatException anymore (in treatException) but just throw a RuntimeWrappedException
  - filter refactoring: exceptions are passed on, not treatException-ed anymore until the ErrorFilter handles them
