TODO new MDD parser:

- validation rules:
    - adapt mak-tools for new validation rules, function syntax, multi-unique keys (mdd viewer)

- bug entry about better validation, esp. multi-field validation. comparison validation rules should use the mql query analysis combined
  with a special 3rd pass that does expression evaluation, that way it would be possible to use query fragments as boolean
  validation functions (multi-field expression evaluation). however this needs more design & the use-cases are not sure of yet.

  - bug entry, decide what to do when a multi-field validation rule doesn't get all its arguments

OPTIMIZATION:
- use caching for creation of virtual fields (from definitions), to avoid parsing twice the same def ?
