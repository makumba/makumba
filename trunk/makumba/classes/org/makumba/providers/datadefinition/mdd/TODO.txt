TODO new MDD parser:

- fix unit tests

- set can't have unique modifier

- finish implementation of comparison validation rule

- analyser/postprocessor: add method that checks the validity of a path
	- addMultiUniqueKey in MddANalyzeWalker
  
- http://bugs.best.eu.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1098

OPTIMIZATION:
- use caching for creation of virtual fields (from definitions), to avoid parsing twice the same def ?
