<b>Makumba</b> is a technology designed by <a href="http://www.BEST.eu.org">BEST</a>
that helps you to rapidly develop web applications that keep their data in a database   (i.e. data driven web
applications). It is implemented in Java and offers a Java API and a JSP
tag library to the web app developer. The technology   has been in use since
late 2001, and is being further developed continuously,   based on users'
experience and requests.

<tr>
<td>First you <b>describe the data</b> in a text file (complex applications
have of course more types of data, with pointers from one to the other).
The text file (called <a href="makumba-spec.html#Data_Description">data
definition</a>) contains lines like:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name= char[30] ;Name</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dob= date     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;Date of birth</tt>
</p>
<p>Say you call the above record a "Person". Having this information, Makumba
can generate a lot of things. It can
<b>generate SQL</b> statements that
do read/write/search operations to <a href="SQL-drivers.html">database</a>
of your choice. We currently support MySQL, PostgreSQL and ODBC but many
other databases can be suported. What's more, you can copy data from one
database to another (this is very important in BEST, we port data a lot,
we develop on Windows with ODBC or MySQL and run on Linux with Postgres,
etc).&nbsp;
<p>At the interface<b> </b>level, Makumba can <b>generate html
              </b>for inserting, editing, viewing and deleting data from the
  database. You don't have to care about making the HTML statements, parsing
  the CGI arguments, etc. A lot is done for you. <br>
</p>
<p>For instance, this will show a selected person. You mix HTML
  and makumba jsp tags to get the desired view :&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote><tt>&lt;mak:object from="general.Person p" where="<span
 style="font-style: italic;">uniqueCondition</span>"&gt;</tt> <br>
                   <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;mak:value expr="p.name"/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
                <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;was born on</tt><tt> &lt;mak:value expr="p.dob"/&gt;</tt>
                <br>
                   <tt>&lt;/mak:object&gt;</tt></blockquote>

            <p>If you wish to add a new Person to your database, you can just
write the following code. It takes care of creating an input form in HTML,
and arranges for all necessary database commands to be performed after submit.
            </p>

            <blockquote><tt>&lt;mak:newForm type="general.Person"&gt;<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Name : &lt;mak:input name="name"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;</tt><br>
                     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Date of birth : &lt;mak:input
 name="dob"/&gt;</tt> <br>
                     <tt>&lt;/mak:newForm&gt;</tt> <br>
                 </blockquote>

            <p>Makumba will choose appropriate input controls for each datatype,
as indicated by the data definition  above. </p>

            <p>Behind the HTML pages, developers can optionally write "business
logic" in Java that adds certain operations to the basic actions (insert,
edit, delete). For this, the full power of Java, enhanced with the makumba
API for e.g. database handling, is available.</p>

 <p>So more or less this is it. Lotus Notes does the same but we found
  it impossible to use it because of visual programming (rather than plain
 text files) and other problems. Other tools (say MS Access) have similar
problems, plus we don't want to be dependent on one technology. We want to
work with plain text files because it's easy to cooperate at a distance using
them. We want everything to be simple for the web app developer.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: these webpages are a bit out-of-date,
as all our effort is going to using, developing and designing future enhancements
of makumba. We apologize for that.&nbsp;</p>
