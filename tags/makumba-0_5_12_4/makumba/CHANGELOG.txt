0.5.12.4; 7 dec 2004 cristi
fixed minor bug: the reason of a OQL failed parsing in update was not shown

0.5.12.3; 27 nov 2004 cristi
fixed minor bug: the return value of Database.read() was not a proper Dictionary

0.5.12.2; 4 nov 2004 cristi
fixed bugs 55 and 57 (query and mak:list start and limit, also documented)
improved a bit documentation in regard to multiple forms and deprecated mak:list features

0.5.12.1; 19 oct 2004 cristi
fixed a packaging error. org.makumba.db.Lock.mdd was missing from the 0.5.12 package

0.5.12; 27 aug 2004 cristi
first version that only works with JSP 2.0
implemented some makumba functions: mak:count(), mak:maxCount(), mak:lastCount()

0.5.11.2; 15 aug 2004 cristi
support for the standar servlet authentication mechanism (bug 663)
the support is as follows: 
- the users and roles can be configured in the servlet container (e.g. Tomcat)
- security constraints limiting some parts of the site to some users and roles can be declared in the webapp descriptor (web.xml)
- if the value of the R attribute is requested (e.g. via $R or via mak:attribute) 
and R is not present in the HTTP session, 
and the standard servlet authentication indicates that there is a user U logged in and has the role R, 
- then the value U is returned. 
BL checkAttributes() can use Attributes.setAttribute() to transform the String attribute U into a pointer, or anything else.
- otherwise, the old mechanism is used to search for R (in the page attributes, in findR() BL method, in the HTTP parameters)
so the old login mechanism is still supported but the standard servlet mechanism (if used) takes precedence.

0.5.11.1; 30 jul 2004 cristi
support for Attributes.setAttribute()
fixed a problem with tomcat 5 and tomcat > 4.1.20; the jar now includes META-INF/taglib.tld

0.5.11; 21 jul 2004 cristi
- refactoring to ensure efficient use of memory (fix for bug 709). soft caches were tested quite sucesfully in production
- initial number of db connections is configurable in the db connection file

0.5.10.5; 9 jul 2004, cristi
Made sure that some resources are immediately freed at context reload, without waiting for garbage collection. Connections are freed and closed that way.

0.5.10.4; 17 jun 2004, cristi
The first stable release after a long time, incorporating major changes like transactions, which needed testing and were harder to release:

adler; 16 jun 2004: fixed bug 103: reduce upload memory
cristi; 10 jun 2004: fixed bug 699, pages executed without controller (e.g. from 404 handler) lead to infinite recursion
cristi; 10 jun 2004: fixed bug 697, dots in <mak:input > names produced error
cristi; 1 jun 2004: fixed bug 695, too often occurence of "servlet call not found in stacktrace"
cristi; 24 may 2004: closed bug 430, real type
cristi; 24 may 2004: fixed bug 686, problem with spaces in OQL queries
cristi; 23 may 2004: fixed bug 48, transactions and locking
cristi; 17 may 2004: fixed bug 544, support for @include
cristi; 25 apr 2004: fixed bug: NotUniqueError was not detected in updates
cristi; 21 apr 2004: fixed bug 37 (multiple forms). 
- addForms can add to the subsets of object produced by the enclosing newForm.
- any number of levels of form inclusion is possible but only the outermost form can have an action, onSubmit, and method and other attributes specific to HTML forms. 
- all form actions take place in a single transaction, which is rolled back by the controller filter if there is an error. 
- after_ methods are not executed in correct order (bug 689)
cristi; 21 apr 2004: fixed bug 56. data inconsistencies between queries in groups of mak:lists are not possible anymore because all queries in a page are executed in a single (repeatable-read) transaction
cristi; 7 apr 2004: fixed bug 4: unique keyword in MDDs. values that break unique constraints are detected and reported.
cristi; 7 apr 2004: fixed bug 643: oldstyle indexes are dropped automatically 
cristi; 6 apr 2004: fixed small bug: OQL errors reported as internal
cristi; 1 apr 2004: MDDs read from JARs can be displayed by the syntax colouring org.makumba.devel classes
cristi; 1 apr 2004: db= can be a <%= jsp runtime expression %>

cristi; 25 jan 2004: fixed bug 655 (Communication link failure). added staling prevention to the connection pool 
stefan; 16 jan 2004: bug 512 fixed (Makumba fails to create new tables with Connector/J 3.0.8 and later). Ready, but halted by unfinished work done on bug 4. cristi: this is blocked mainly by work related to the fix of bug 48, that can only be relesed afer thorough tests. 
stefan; 24 dec 2003: bug 661 fixed (whitespace in field definitions), fixed file also contains unique keyword support, so it needs to wait for that to be released

cristi; 6 nov 2003: published FieldDefinition.getNameFor(int)

stefan; 16 oct 2003: bug 516 (Names of identifiers in DB need to be made valid)
cristi; 24 sept: a number of fixes related to ODBC (reopened bug 564) in org.makumba.db.sql.RecordManager (revisions 2.2-2.4). 
cristi;21 sep 2003: bug 48: added transactions: commit() and rollback() in org.makumba.Database. Database.close() commits the transaction. Business logic rolls back the transaction in case of errors in the BL code, and committs it otherwise by calling . default transaction isolation is REPEATABLE READ. Autocommit is always OFF.
stefan; 11 sep 2003: bug 565 (isolated SQL syntax for index creation)
stefan; 22 jul 2003: bug 4 improved (uses databaseMetaData,getIndexInfo() to manageIndexes() )
stefan; 16 jul 2003: bug 3 fixed (ptrIndex and ptrOne are declared as unique)
stefan; 15 jul 2003: bug 4 fixed (unique indexes created and dropped in the DB as needed during table checking)
stefan; 4 jul 2003: unique MDD keyword supported on abstract level and is used in table creation (part of bug 4)

fred;  6 sep 2003: added Created-By: to the manifest (java version and vendor for the build)

0.5.5.16; 9 dec 2002 cristi
added the path info to login form action to make login work in the pages that use path info in the URL, e.g. /archive/doc/xx-yy

0.5.5.15; 6 dec 2002 cristi
added a small servlet so parade can set the logging root at webapp runtime.
some more meaningful cache names

0.5.5.14; 4 dec 2002 cristi

0.5.5.13; 3 dec 2002 cristi

added cache size info
soft reference alternative for static caches now available (util.SoftNamedResources)

0.5.5.11; 27 nov 2002 cristi
makumba registers the loading time for applications to know it

0.5.5.10; 27 nov 2002 cristi
refactored to expose the OQL analyzer and remove dependencies between packages

0.5.5.9; 26 nov 2002 cristi

0.5.5.8; 20 nov 2002 cristi
simpler AttributeParametrizer (will need rewrite anyway)
autoReconnect=true is default now (to address bug 139)
minor bug fixed in RecordManager (guards against DBConnectionWrapper class cast exception)

0.5.5.7; 20 nov 2002 cristi
better database information

0.5.5.6; 20 nov 2002 cristi

0.5.5.1; 6 nov 2002 cristi
fixed deletion of objects coming from another db

0.5.6.1; 6 jan 2003 cristi
- refactored the forms further, only the jsptaglib1-dependent features are now left in org.makumba.view.jsptaglib, the rest of the stuff is in form responders, org.makumba.controller
action
- while refactoring, i got more acquainted to the jsptaglib code, especially forms, so there are more features...
- <mak:action> is now added and documented to support complex form actions that include makumba tags
- infrastructure for multiple forms is now in place, and runs ok in the 'particular' case of the simple form. 

0.5.6; 17 dec 2002 cristi
- the need for "first makumba tag" is eliminated for login and form response
- now anything can be a response or can request login, including plain HTTPs or JPGs. that also means that all separate (non-include) accesses (e.g. images) are authenticated!
- as excpected, authentication is only done once, included JSPs are not authenticated
- some tag classes moved (login, logout, response) so tomcat/work/Standalone/localhost/context_name will have to be deleted before working with this version
- quite a lot of the form response code moved from org.makumba.view.jsptaglib to org.makumba.controller.http, org.makumba.controller.html, org.makumba.controller.jsp. that should make the taglib rewrite easier.

0.5.5; 3 nov 2002
cristi: joined the 0.5.4 branch with the main branch

stefan: fixed bug 75

cristi: work on build.xml
- added the tagJar target, which tags a version from the current checked out branch, but doesn't publish it, just places it in util-java/lib
- added makeJar which compiles and jars any version of makumba and places it in util-java/lib
- deleted target dist2, put jsptaglib2 in another branch and use tagJar instead
- added description to main targets

0.5.4.4; 3 nov 2002 cristi

fixed a design flaw: the text swapping code was allocating 32k for each text, no matter how small. due to that, database copies needed huge memory. every other code that uses texts was affected, due to CPU-hungry memory allocation efforts.

0.5.3.20; 19 mar 2002 stefan
cristi: pageContext.findAttribute(pageContext.EXCEPTION) should return a reason for exception (if specified in logic). instead of 
mak:response for login forms

0.5.3.19; 14 mar 2002 stefan
lowercase generated delete link html tag 
integer html tag parameters in quotes (size, rows, cols...) in FieldFormatter

0.5.3.18; 14 mar 2002 stefan
lowercase generated html tags
html tag parameters in quotes
removed unnesecary \n

0.5.3.17; 13 mar 2002 cristi
better treatment of dataDefinitions -> dataDefinitions/ redirect

0.5.3.16; 13 mar 2002 cristi
classes/dataDefinitions/ is preferred to classes/ when looking for the root of dataDefinitions/

0.5.3.15; 12 mar 2002 cristi
performance improvement in choiceEditor: if the field is hidden, options are not read

0.5.3.14; 6 mar 2002 cristi
fixed bug: "cannot have <mak:list > in <mak:form > when the form is root tag" (tnx Amo). lists in other kind of root forms (e.g. newForm) might still present problems
adjusted the date printouts at database opening/closing

0.5.3.13; 4 mar 2002 cristi
time zone and locale are now treated uniformly 
better error handling in org.makumba.Text

0.5.3.12; 21 feb 2002 stefan
org.makumba.devel.jspViewer adds context path before links in header

0.5.3.11; 17 feb 2002 stefan
fixed bug: login tag is now context aware

0.5.3.10; 9 feb 2002 cristi
fixed small bug: BL detection didn't work if MakumbaController was missing
made the source viewers generate correct links if the context is not root

0.5.3.9; 7 feb 2002 cristi
fixed bug: only 30 JSP->OQL query attributes were supported correctly due to an int (32 bit) mask. using BigInteger instead (tnx Jesus)
fixed bugs in Text and LongData related to Text.toString()
fixed bug in NullableValueStrategy, more precise determination of the enclosing query status before repetition
LongData is now fully used in long page swapping

0.5.3.8; 5 feb 2002 cristi
made all long texts swap to disk. swapping of the pages uses the same code.

requiredAttributes() replaced by checkAttributes(Attributes, Database) in the business logic

UnauthenticatedException (wrong username/password) was separated from UnauthorizedException (good authentication but no access to a resource) are now separated, but both produce a login screen

a more general catch() ensures catching more errors in the business logic.

db reconnection message more clear 

toto: improved org.makumba.util.NameCase

0.5.3.7 3 feb 2002, stefan
fixed bug: dateEditor was system date dependant, generating weird interface in february... 

0.5.3.6 1 feb 2002, stefan
new jsp tag <mak:version/> prints a CVS tag 

0.5.3.5 31 jan 2002, cristi
small feature: logging of connection and disconnection dates

0.5.3.4 29 jan 2002, cristi
fixed bug: the fix of "mak:value with nullable expression" in 0.5.3.3 produced wrong results if the nullable <mak:value > was in a looping <mak:list> (tnx Stefan)

fixed bug: tag parameters "lineSeparator" and longLineLength produced NPE in org.makumba.view.FieldFormatter#checkParams (tnx Stefan)

fixed bug: mak:input type="hidden" dataType="char" (and text) produced strange HTML when the field value is null (tnx Raul). 

devel feature: shortened stack traces shown to developer in org.makumba.devel.TagExceptionServlet. eliminated long tomcat-specific stacktrace lines.

0.5.3.3 25 jan 2002, cristi
fixed bug: double mak:value with nullable expression didn't work
fixed bug: orderBy in a mak:list that had an enclosing mak:list produced empty result

0.5.3.2 22 jan 2002, cristi
fixed the null date problem at form submit

0.5.3.1 21 jan 2002, cristi
fixed a bug that was not displaying some <mak:object> bodies at first page run
files in the servlet context are now linked by the source viewers

0.5.3 18 jan 2002, cristi
fixed bugs related to checking values (for int, charEnum). tnx Stefan, Jesus, Janez.

devel: source file paths are printed in canonical form now (no more \..\ )

design change: mak:attriute sets the attribute to null if exceptionVar is present

mak:input can now have both a dataType and an internal declared type. their compatibilty is computed. before, if both were present, an error was shown.

since representing set int{ ...}  and set char {...} as separate set is not convenient at presentaion level, they were updated to work again
- specification update, removed their deprecation
- at database level, they can now be updated with Vectors (similar to sets to foreign types)
- OQL was modified to interpret a "lonely" label of type setint or setchar as the set member (rather than a pointer to the record where the member is kept) 
- presentation level (org.makumba.view.jsptaglib.set*EnumEditor)

bugfix: files included in login.jsp are not asked for login, to avoid infinite loops (tnx Priit)

groupBy is not inherited to inner mak:list anymore (tnx Fred)

0.5.2.3 17 jan 2002
stefan: deleteLink works with actions containing parameters (no double '?')

0.5.2.2 16 jan 2002
cristi: fixed a bug that was executing form actions multiple times due to different PageContext objects being created at jsp:include (double inserts signaled by Jesus and Stefan)

cristi: fixed a documentation bug for addForm (which had messed up Raul's mind)

0.5.2.1 15 jan 2002
cristi: improvements in file upload memory profile, which required improvements in org.makumba.Text, and changes in org.makumba.db.sql.textManager

0.5.2 14 jan 2002
cristi: implemented file upload
