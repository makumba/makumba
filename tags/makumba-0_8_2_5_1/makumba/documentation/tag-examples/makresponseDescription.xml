    &lt;mak:response/&gt; prints information about the results of the actions that were performed by the makumba
    controller (e.g. for a form submit or deleteLink): It either displays the message="..." parameter of the form tag
    (in green) in case of success, or (in red) the message of a uncaught LogicException resulting from Business Logic.
    Other exception types will provoke an exception page.
    </p><p>
    The unformatted message is available as request-scope attribute makumba.response. The jsp page can get hold of the
    message using e.g.</p>
<source><![CDATA[<% String s = (String) request.getAttribute("makumba.response") %>]]></source>
<p>
    Similarly, request-scope attribute
    <code>makumba.successfulResponse</code> is set only in case of successful action execution.
</p>
<source><![CDATA[<% if (null == request.getAttribute("makumba.successfulResponse")) { /* action failed */ } %>]]></source>
