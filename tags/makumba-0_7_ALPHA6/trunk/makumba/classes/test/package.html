Contains automated tests for various makumba components.
<p>
Currently relies on {@link junit.framework}, but additional types of tests 
will probably need additional testing methods. Testing {@link org.makumba.view.jsptaglib} 
seems much more difficult and will be probably done with <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/">Cactus</a>.
