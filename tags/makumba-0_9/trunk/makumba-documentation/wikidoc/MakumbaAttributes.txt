!!!makumba Attributes

Java Server Pages use attributes to keep the state of the application (request-, session- and context-scoped).

makumba builds upon this its own notion of Attributes that keep the read-only state of a makumba task. They represent the "environment" of that Makumba task.

The typical example is a JSP page during execution, with its HTTP and session parameters as attributes. Since other kinds of attributes are possible, the attribute specification is kept HTTP-independent. [Makumba Business Logics|JavaBusinessLogics] code sees the attributes as an [org.makumba.Attributes|api:Attributes] object.
