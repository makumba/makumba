FEATURE REQUEST: login should be able to logout first (if the login was correct)

business logic per type?

prevent new/add reload?

MultipleLogicException: more fields from a makumba form can be wrong. Then compose a big exception as a map fieldName:LogicException. later on, it can be handled by re-displaying the form and displaying an error near each mak:input 

logicError.jsp: instead of displaying "Makumba Business Logic error" when LogicException occurs, have a JSP that shows it more nicely

include files should be able to have different BL?

look for servlet API login standards

hooks to catch any db change, from anywhere? 

- detect handler class changes, and re-make handler
