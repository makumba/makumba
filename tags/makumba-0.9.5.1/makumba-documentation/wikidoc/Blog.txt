__This release is not a drop-in replacement. Read ''special changes'' below__

* Bug fixes
** allowing multi-types also for different pointer types
** several fixes in the data object viewer servlet: charEnum and setIntEnum don't cause errors
** fixing type computation for case-when, especially when there was no else part anymore, displaying ptrOne and setComplex, allowing to view ptrOne and setComplex details
** some date fields (maybe those resulting from function calls) returned a byte-array, treating that in TableManager
** date now accepted as field name in antlr MDD parser, also fields starting with low... accepted (by incresing lexer lookahead to avoid collision with 'lower' keyword)
** fix in DataDefinitionImpl affecting the order of consecutive self-referring sets in getFieldNames()
** improving checkValue so that it throws an exception when a Long value is bigger than the maximal value an Integer can take. fixes [#1071|http://trac.makumba.org/ticket/1071]
** check for number of arguments to single-field validation rules, fixes [#1239|http://trac.makumba.org/ticket/1239]
** better error message for impossible composite update/insert, fixes [#656|http://trac.makumba.org/ticket/656]
** fix for non-applied single-field validation rules in a subfield applying to a field having the same name as a field of the parent
** fixing [#1242|http://trac.makumba.org/ticket/1242]
** fixing [#1240|http://trac.makumba.org/ticket/1240]
** applying database transaction rollback in case of form validation errors for all form operations, as otherwise this may lead to an inconsistent db state

* New features
** annotating the list-tags in the JSP viewer with the queries they generated
** developer tool to convert intEnum to setIntEnum, copying the existing data
** adding DBSV format as input option in pointer value converter
** adding Data Definition and Query Function Inliner providers to Makumba configuration overview 
** improved mak:info tag
** improvement to JSP viewer: displaying a pop-up with generated queries for the list/object tags; showing analysis errors 
** error log viewer initial revision
** EntityClassGenerator, generating JPA-annotated POJO classes based on MDDs
** javassist-based reader for method annotations

* Internal changes
** fixing release mechanism broken due to build path change
** fixing testing mechanism, test cases can record their comparison files one by one (not globally anymore)
** extended tests for MDD functions

* Special changes
** new first-pass query inliner
** moved org.makumba.providers.datadefinition.makumba.* to attic. ===> this means that %%code dataDefinitionProvider=recordinfo %% in the provider section of Makumba.conf is no longer working.
** changes in %%code org.makumba.DataDefinition%%: %%code getReferenceFields()%% and %%code getUniqueFields()%% are moved to %%code ReferenceChecker%%, %%code checkUpdate()%% and %%code checkFieldNames()%% to %%code CRUDOperationProvider%%
** changes in %%code org.makumba.FieldDefinition%%: %%code checkUpdate()%% moved to %%code CRUDOperationProvider%%
** dropping support of "requiredAttributes" as deprecated alternative to checkAttributes. Fixes [#611|http://trac.makumba.org/ticket/611].

!! Spring 2010 development meeting
05 Mar 2010 \\
As a follow-up on the outcomes of the makumba meeting held last November in Copenhagen, next month will see another gathering, this time in Vienna.
On the agenda, hands-on activities such as:
* cleanup / refactoring work to ease the integration with [JSF|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Server_Faces] (to progressively adopt it as the underlying presentation technology)
* implementation of implicit, MDD-based, authorization
* design of accountability support

!! Makumba [0.8.2.7|https://sourceforge.net/projects/makumba/files/Makumba/makumba-0_8_2_7.jar/download] is out!
29 Jan 2010
* Form submission message also shown for successful response
* Fixing bug in MDD parser that would prevent overriding of IDD fields in sub-tables (setComplex, ptrOne)
* Enhancing analysis engine: reporting invalid values for tag attributes can now be handled through AnalysableTag#registerAttributeValues()
* Improving error reporting: when an error occurs during the analysis or execution of a tag, we fetch the exact line of that tag and display it to the user, keeping the analysis status in the servlet context (as attribute) until the error does not occur anymore, so that we can keep on displaying the error message on successive requests (page reloads).
* Extending/refactoring page analysis: introducing AnalysableElement and ElementData to abstract from Tag, and allow for another kind of element (EL expression).
* Moving all the code required for accurate error handling into AnalysableElement
* Small fixes reported by bug detection plugin
* Fixing small bug in error viewer: removing generation of a link to the current directory in error pages when encountering a '.'

* Tests running with jetty
