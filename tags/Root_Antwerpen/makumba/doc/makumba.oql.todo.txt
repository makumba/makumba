BUG: these queries should be equivalent, first doesn't return anything, second does
SELECT a1 FROM best.johnny.Activity a1, a1.season.deadlines ad1, best.johnny.Activity a2, a2.season.deadlines ad2 WHERE ad1.what=1 AND ad1.when<=$1 and ad1.what=2 AND ad1.when>=$1 and a1=a2 and a1=$2
"SELECT a1 FROM best.johnny.Activity a1, a1.season.deadlines ad1, best.johnny.Activity a2, a2.season.deadlines ad2 WHERE ad1.what=1 AND ad1.when<=$1 and a1=$2 and ad2.what=2 AND ad2.when>=$1 and a2=a1

Bug: duplicate labels are accepted in OQL, should not be
Bug: when lower-case name of the index pointer is used (arc.archive instead of arc.Archive)
Bug: labels might interfere with SQL keywords!!
Bug: table names interfere with OQL keywords!!
Bug: ODBC like operator has different %
Bug: ODBC date1 < date2 doesn't work

support methods in OQL? text.length(), date.getDay(), char.toLowerCase()...

NOT LIKE is missing

relative OQL parser?(best.Student this, this.name=blabla)
OQL group tag seems to be different in the original parser from the one implemented now.
SQL functions in OQL (concat, strcmp, etc)? ansi standard?
OQL functions for MDD? title()=concat(concat(name, ' '), surname)

- better computation of root keys for subselects. the minimal set is needed (attachement->document->archive->owner only needs to select arhive to be able to connect owner).
