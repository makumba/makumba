BUG: enlargement of form field doesn't work in response.
<mak:input type="char[20]">  and then you enlarge it, the response will fail.
BUG: Some tags use ValueTag internally but their error messages report ValueTag instead of talking about the respective tag name (mak:input, mak:attribute)

BUG: in counting with groupby, test/error-count.jsp on malaka?

BUG: edit object="a.b.c" doesn't work. should be error or it should work

BUG: Sometimes the list tag returns empty results when multiple reloads are done at start. This is a small bug, it occurs very infrequenlty. It has to do with the databae taking a long time to check all tables

BUG/FEATURE: if handler method is not found, the form (not only the response) should show error

Programmer interaction mode: 
- view checkboxes turning features on-off at the top of the page
- features: profiling, view queries, recommendations
- view queries in JSPx as well
- if makumba errors occur in page, show errors in red over the source file (jspx-like but w/ errors)

mak:link for easier genertion of links 

dataType compulsory in inputs?

deleteLink needs to accept other arguments than the ones it generates itself

conditional separator <mak:separator change="lbg.type="xxx" >...</mak:separators>

allow <mak:input name="label.field" .../> (currently just field seems to be confusing. familiarity with mak:value expr=...

<mak:input name="sddsfsfsd" type="best.minerva.Student#activityKinds" />
<mak:input name="sddsfsfsd" type="set best.minerva.Student#activityKinds" />

some makumba tags only print ---- on the log (e.g. forms). they should not print anything or they should print more info.

distinct= true is not implemented

generate views and forms automatically (in the order from the MDD) 
have a <head > to configure fields

makumba-aware includes
<mak:list>
  <jsp:include ...> knows in which list it is
</mak:list>

- mak:list implementation could detect html output and, if output is in html, eliminate empty spaces

- save the form responders state between server restarts
	writeObject and readObject for FormResponder
	name of db, name of controller class
	FieldEditor.readFrom takes the parameters as well
	build the editor from the type, save the type.

- better computation of root keys for subselects. the minimal set is needed (attachement->document->archive->owner only needs to select arhive to be able to connect owner).
