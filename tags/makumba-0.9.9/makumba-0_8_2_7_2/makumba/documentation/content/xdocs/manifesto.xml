			<p> When developing a webapp, coding should go <strong>directly to the most important
				things</strong>. Reducing the amount of time necessary to develop a dynamic website
				is crucial - complicated DAO objects are nice, but in 99% of the case you won't
				need them in for a small/medium site. makumba cuts off the redundant and not
				important code and lets you focus on what matters: bringing information to
				the user.</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Everything is a query</strong>. There's a lot of information you
				want to store and show and queries are a simple way to do so. Just write down
				what data you want, and makumba takes it from the database directly to the
				page for you. It doesn't matter if what you are looking for is complex,
				Makumba lets you query for everything you could think of. Plus, you can cut
				your queries in smaller chunks and let makumba combine them for you.</p>
			
			<p>Developing a webapp should be
				<strong>simple</strong>. Knowing complicated programming languages is
				good, but it shouldn't be required to create advanced sites. You can learn to
				use makumba in only a couple of hours, and its advanced developer support
				will help you do many things without much hussle. With the code generator you
				can even create entire parts of a site in no time, without coding
				anything.</p>
			
			<p>Your webapps should be fast. Today's Internet users are expecting
				<strong>performance</strong> and this is what Makumba delivers. It doesn't matter if your
				page is complex, makumba optimises the operations it has to do so that
				surfing your sites will feel smooth.</p>
