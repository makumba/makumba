This page explains how the makumba web-app and the database layer should be configured in order to use the UTF-8 encoding.

!!! Makumba.conf
In the [DataSource section of Makumba.conf|MakumbaConfiguration#section-MakumbaConfiguration-GlobalDataSourceConfigurationDataSourceConfig] set the encoding to UTF-8:
%%prettify
{{{
encoding=utf8
}}}%%

!!! Servlet container configuration
In some cases you will need to configure your servlet container so as to use UTF-8 by default.

In the case of Apache Tomcat, edit the conf/server.xml and add %%code URIEncoding="UTF-8" %% and %%code useBodyEncodingForURI="true" %% to the Connector definition.
This is to pass UTF-8 through the URL-s so that no characters get missing.
%%prettify
{{{
<Connector URIEncoding="UTF-8" useBodyEncodingForURI="true" port="..." maxThreads="..." minSpareThreads="..." maxSpareThreads="..." enableLookups="..." redirectPort="..." acceptCount="..." connectionTimeout="..." disableUploadTimeout="..." /> %%
}}}%%

!!! Database conversion
If you want to convert a previous database to have access to the utf-8
character set,
* do not forget to set all the binary fields in the db to binary so that no data is lost
* set the collation to utf-8 everywhere using this command for every table (for MYSQL, adapt according to your DB engine):
%%prettify
{{{
ALTER TABLE company_Employee_ SET CHARACTER SET utf8;
}}}%%
