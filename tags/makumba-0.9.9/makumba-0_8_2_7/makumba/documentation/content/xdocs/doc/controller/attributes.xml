        Java Server Pages use attributes to keep the state of the application. Makumba builds upon that its own notion of Attributes that keep the read-only state of a makumba task.
        They represent the "environment" of that makumba task. The typical example is a JSP page during execution, with its HTTP and session parameters as attributes. 
        Since other kinds of attributes are possible, the attribute specification is kept HTTP-independent.
        Makumba BL code sees the attributes as an org.makumba.Attributes  object.
