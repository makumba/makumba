This page explains how the makumba web-app and the database layer should be configured in order to support UTF-8.

!!! server.xml

In makumba/tomcat/conf/server.xml add %%code URIEncoding="UTF-8" %% and %%code useBodyEncodingForURI="true" %% to the Connector definition.
This is to pass utf-8 through the URL-s so that no characters get missing.
[{Code 

            <Connector URIEncoding="UTF-8" useBodyEncodingForURI="true" port="..." maxThreads="..." minSpareThreads="..." maxSpareThreads="..." enableLookups="..." redirectPort="..." acceptCount="..." connectionTimeout="..." disableUploadTimeout="..." /> %%
}]

!!! web.xml

In public_html/WEB-INF/web.xml, the makumba_charset filter must be the first one in the list:
[{Code 

            <filter>
                <filter-name>makumba_charset</filter-name>
                <filter-class>org.makumba.controller.http.CharsetFilter</filter-class>
            </filter>
}]

public/WEB-INF/web.xml also needs to contain the makumba_charset mapping:
[{Code 

            <filter-mapping>
                <filter-name>makumba_charset</filter-name>
                <url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>
            </filter-mapping>
}]            

!!! sqlEngines.properties

In makumba/classes/org/makumba/db/sql/sqlEngines.properties, indicate that the db wrapper has utf-8 support by adding (for MySQL, adapt according to your DB engine):
[{Code 

            mysql.utf8=true
}]

!!! Database

If you want to convert a previous database to have access to the utf-8
character set,
* do not forget to set all the binary fields in the db to binary so that no data is lost
* set the collation to utf-8 everywhere using this command for every table (for MYSQL, adapt according to your DB engine):
[{Code 

            ALTER TABLE company_Emlpoyee_ SET CHARACTER SET utf8;
}]

!!! Makumba.conf

In public_html/WEB-INF/classes/Makumba.conf set the encoding to UTF-8:
[{Code 

            encoding=utf8
}]
