!!Pointer
A Makumba Pointer is an object that uniquely identifies a database record. It can have different forms:
* the internal form, which is used by Makumba to access the object in the database
* the Java form, as Pointer object
* the external form, which is a 7 character long string that uniquely identifies the record and its type. This form is mostly used in JSP pages, as CGI parameters.

For instance, let’s consider the following JSP page listProjects.jsp:

%%prettify
{{{
<%@ taglib uri="http://www.makumba.org/presentation" prefix="mak"%>

<mak:list from=”company.Project p” where=”p = $project”>
    <mak:value expr=”p.name” />, pointer: <mak:value expr=”p” /><br />
    <mak:value expr=”p” var=”projectPointer” />
</mak:list>
}}}%%

This page can then be called with the following URI: %%Code listProjects.jsp?projects=nxdcdc2%%

%%code nxdcdc2%% is the external form of the Makumba pointer to a specific record.

The %%Code <mak:value expr="p" />%% will also print this string, whereas the second [mak:value|ValueTag] will not result in any printed result, but will make "projectPointer" accessible as a Java page attribute inside the [mak:list|ListTag], having Pointer as its type. It could then be used by casting it to a Pointer, however, this is rarely needed, since the "project" page parameter can be used in all Makumba tags through the %%Code $project%% attribute.
