!!!Comparison between makumba and JSF 2.0

Both technologies seem to have evolved in parallel. An integration of JSF 2.0 as view for makumba seems to make a lot of sense.

[{Table

|| Concern || Makumba || JSF 2.0 || Comments

| display action results / messages to the user
| <mak:response /> - displays form messages indicated in the <mak:form> 'message' attribute, the application logic and the validation error messages that could not be assigned to a form element
| <h:messages /> - displays all messages that come from validators or set in the application logic through FacesMessage\\
| pretty much the same thing

| send message from application logic
| %%prettify {{{
throw new LogicException("This is an error");}}}%%
| %%prettify {{{
FacesMessage message = new FacesMessage("Invalid email address");
throw new ValidatorException(message);}}}%%
| FacesMessage brings support for localization

| display form annotation messages
| <mak:form annotation="after/before/both/none">
| <h:message for="inputId" />
| mak seems to automate this process more than JSF 2.0

| form validation
| validation rules in MDD or custom application logic
| application logic, greatly simplified through validation annotations ([JSR 303|http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303])
|

| navigation
| simple navigation model using <mak:form> 'action' attribute, or reloading of the page in case of errors if this is the configured behavior
| - <h:commandButton> 'action' attribute forwards to JSF page with same name as the action (if found)\\
- navigation rules specified in faces-config.xml, much in the same fashion as Struts does
