To cancel out a certain attribute, specify the exact name:

[{Code
      
<mak:logout actor="employee"/>
}]

You can remove (cancel-out, logout) multiple attributes from the session by using <mak:logout actor="attribute name"> several times and/or by using the star (*) wildcard, e.g.:

[{Code

<mak:logout actor="demo_*"/> (attributes whose names start with "demo_")
<mak:logout actor="*app"/> (attributes whose names end with "app")
<mak:logout actor="*"/> (all attributes; this "invalidates" the session)
}]
