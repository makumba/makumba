!!!Welcome to makumba! 

Makumba is a framework for rapid and sustainable web-app development.

The core ideas are:

* __creating web-apps should be simple__ and there should not be a need to have a deep technical background. For this, Makumba relies on simple languages such as HTML markup and MQL (a SQL-like query language).

* __code should be sustainable__. Makumba ensures this by relying on simple languages and a set of best practices that make the code understandable also for someone who did not write it.

* __everything is a query-fragment__. Displaying and modifying data is made simple especially through powerful features such as the makumba list and makumba forms.

* __breaking MVC is cool__. Makumba does not strictly follow MVC, because its design makes it possible to write highly maintainable code without this pattern and all the indirection it brings in.
