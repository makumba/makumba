Makumba comes with a number of convenient developer tools.
Those tools can be enabled or disabled at will (one might not want e.g. the data query tool to be enabled in a production environment) in the [configuration|MakumbaConfiguration#section-MakumbaConfiguration-MakumbaTools] file. The default location is under /mak-tools but this can be also changed if wished.\\
In addition to the list below, more tools are expected to be developed in the future, allowing e.g. to clean up database columns not used anymore or to migrate the data when doing data structure refactoring (e.g. when moving from a pointer to set). 


!!! Code Viewers

!! JSP Viewer
The JSP code viewer comes with handy highlighting of JSP, JSTL and of course Makumba tags. It also provides convenient links to the data definitions used in the page, to the logic discovery (see below) as well as to the version history of this particular file.\\

[{Box

By default the JSP viewer can be accessed by using the .jspx extension on any JSP page
}]

!! Data Definition Viewer
The data definition viewer allows to easily check the fields available in a given entity. When a data definition contains references to other entities, links to the corresponding data definitions are provided, making it very easy to navigate from an entity to the other.
When adding new data definitions, the data definition viewer also indicates syntax errors, making it easy to spot and correct any issue.\\
The data definition viewer is also able to provide the list of JSP and Java files in which the entity is used, which comes handy when assessing the impact of a data structure change. For this list of relations to be available, one needs however to run the relation crawler (see below) first. 

[{Box

It is most common to access the data definition viewer from the JSP viewer, but it can also be accessed from (default) /mak-tools/dataDefinitions/
