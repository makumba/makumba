Provides pagination of the results in an enclosing <mak:list>. The tag provides links to the first, previous, next and last item in the result set, and the page number currently displayed. To achieve this, pagination makes use of the information provided by the enclosing %%code <mak:list>%%, i.e. the offset and limit, and automatically computes the total of rows that would be returned by the list, if no limit was specified.
