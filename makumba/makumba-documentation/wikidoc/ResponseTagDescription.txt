%%code <mak:response/>%% prints information about the results of the actions that were performed by the makumba controller (e.g. for a form submit or deleteLink): It either displays the message="..." parameter of the form tag (in green) in case of success, or (in red) the message of a uncaught LogicException resulting from Business Logic. Other exception types will provoke an exception page.

The unformatted message is available as request-scope attribute makumba.response. The jsp page can get hold of the message using e.g.

%%prettify
{{{
<% String s = (String) request.getAttribute("makumba.response") %>
}}}%%

Similarly, request-scope attribute %%code makumba.successfulResponse%% is set only in case of successful action execution.
%%prettify
{{{
<% if (null == request.getAttribute("makumba.successfulResponse")) { /* action failed */ } %>
}}}%%
