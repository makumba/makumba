INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

- install maven (http://maven.apache.org/download.html)

== eclipse set-up

- install m2eclipse (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e/)
- install m2eclipse-extras (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e-extras/)
  - only install the SCM provider, Team/CVS support and WTP support, the rest is not needed
- go to the eclipse maven preferences and add your maven installation instead of the embedded one (http://www.sonatype.com/books/m2eclipse-book/reference/eclipse-sect-maven-preferences.html)
- create a new M2_HOME variable (Preferences->Run/Debug->String substitution) and point it to your maven home directory
  (this step is necessary in order to easily share run configurations) 
- create empty makumba and makhib mysql test databases in mysql; on linux, you can use the "setup-mysql-db.sh" script
- checkout the project
- if needed, configure build.properties
- navigate to the root dir of the makumba project and run (in a console) 'mvn clean install eclipse:eclipse'
- grab a coffee and read a book or paper
- in eclipse, go to File->Import->Existing maven projects and select the makumba project directory.
- you'll get an error due to a problem with m2eclipse. run 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' again and refresh the core project

== IntelliJ IDEA set-up

- create empty makumba and makhib mysql test databases in mysql; on linux, you can use the "setup-mysql-db.sh" script
- check out the project, don't let it be imported right away
- if needed, configure build.properties
- create a new project from the maven model based on the sources you checked out
