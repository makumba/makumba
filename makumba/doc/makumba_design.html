<br>
<h2>Statement of purpose </h2>
(should be put in sentences and posted on www.makumba.org)<br>
<ul>
  <li>fast involvement</li>
  <li>rapid development<br>
  </li>
  <li>based on HTML and SQL knowledge</li>
  <li>unlike popular scripting languages, it still enforces a clean MVC
architecture</li>
  <li>db-driven web applications (clear delimitation of the technology,
easy to migrate out from it)</li>
  <li>simple (few concepts)</li>
  <li>easy to install (few commands/directories/files to work with)</li>
  <li>independent of any commercial technology or data format</li>
  <li>as much as possible "compiled" rather than interpreted (tell the
developer at first page execution that somthing is rotten, rather than
wait for it to blow in production)<br>
  </li>
  <li>personal member development towards java</li>
</ul>
<h2>The issue of design<br>
</h2>
the biggest issue with makumba today is design. <br>
reasons:<br>
<ul>
  <li>design is originalit:. if makumba design weren't original, there
would be no need for makumba, sth else could be used<br>
  </li>
  <li>there was a lot of pressure to stop design and start
implementation, so some parts of makumba are still poorly designed
(while others give its strength and originality)<br>
  </li>
  <li>a lot of stuff had to be implemented from scratch as the standard
or 3rd party technologies at the time (1999-2001) were non-existent, in
bad shape, or uncertain. Even the ubiquitous Tomcat did not exist at
the time, and JSP was in its conceiving stages</li>
</ul>
we should adjust the makumba design so that:<br>
<ul>
  <li>keeps its strength and originality as expressed in the statement
of purpose above</li>
  <li>makes better use of 3rd party technology (especially
java-endorsed standards), taking advantage of their healthy design,
reliability and 'standardness'. <br>
  </li>
  <li>in components where makumba is still considered more original, or
3rd party technologies are still unsatisfactory, publish the respective
part of makumba as a separate, original product</li>
  <li>this will lead to a smaller, easier to maintain, and more
reliable makumba. <br>
  </li>
  <li>eliminating sluggish design will make us more proud and ready to
promote makumba better in the open-source world</li>
</ul>
as such, what we need to do now, is search literature and read, not
write code, except where design is straight-forward and experience from
karamba and other applications clearly shows that a feature is needed,
and can't wait much for redesign.<br>
<br>
how to look at a technology:<br>
<ul>
  <li>is it used by makumba already? if so, does makumba use it to its
full potential (e.g. it may be that makumba adopted the technology
early in its development)</li>
  <li>if not, what would it do for makumba, in which area?</li>
  <li>is it a standard? would it be good for best members' personal
development to learn it?<br>
  </li>
  <li>would the overhead (in installation/configuration, data
conversion, etc) of using that technology be acceptable? would the
development process (makumba usage) be easier? even if it would be a
bit more difficult, are the other advantages important enough?<br>
  </li>
  <li>in general, how will makumba+that technology respect the
statement of purpose?<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Makumba components</h1>
<h2>mak:list engine</h2>
design status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">this is clearly the most original and
powerful part of makumba. <br>
familiarity with SQL within HTML is well encouraged. groups of
mak:lists are nicely combined in a high-performance original way<br>
$attributes are transformed into $1 OQL attributes in an easy
transparent manner<br>
</div>
design still not finished for<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">parametrized query fragments
(especially in orderBy, etc)<br>
</div>
implementation status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">the JSP taglib API is still not enough
for makumba's needs. makumba-specific JSP page parsing needed to be
introduced in the last taglib version<br>
there are small features missing but the new architecture of
org.makumba.view.jsptaglib allows for easy extensions <br>
</div>
3rd-party tools and standards: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">of course many tag libraries (incl the
standard JSTL) know how to do
SQL queries or display tables (JSF) but none combine the two like
mak:list does (for better or worse)<br>
the taglib was designed for JSP 1.1, since then JSP 1.2 and especially
2.0 added more features that, integrated in makumba, may simplify
makumba pages<br>
especially the Expression Language (EL) of JSP 2.0 makes it much easier
to display values by using ${expression } notation<br>
JSTL helps replace java scriptlets. makumba should be integrated more
with it<br>
</div>
<h2>forms</h2>
design status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">keep nice familiarity with HTML, while
taking good advantage of the MDD information. this is a strength of
makumba design<br>
multiple forms are powerful and original<br>
</div>
design still not finished for:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">form annotations<br>
expanding form interaction over more pages<br>
chooser flexibility<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
implementation status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">see unfinished design above<br>
form responders are lost at webapp reload<br>
</div>
3rd-party tools and standards: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">JSF (Java server faces) has excellent
design towards transforming web interaction into component-based
interaction. however, that goes too far into breaking the familiarity
with HTML forms, while bringing in a much less spread familiarity (GUI
component programming)<br>
</div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">MDD (data model)</span></h2>
design status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">a simple, easy to read,
database-neutral data description. a small number of types, that cover
most needs<br>
some concepts could have better names (more related to db theory): set,
internal set/pointer, etc<br>
</div>
design still not finished for:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">the initial ambition was to be
object-oriented: encapsulation is more or less done, but inheritance
and polymorphism are still not addressed. is this really needed? <br>
subtyping is supported but can be made more explicit<br>
business rules. a data model should not only describe data, but also
specify rules on how it can be created and changed<br>
</div>
implementation status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">the parser is a bit messy but it works<br>
</div>
3rd-party tools and standards: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">there is acute need for database theory
reading (to decide whether to have it object-oriented or keep it
relational, etc)<br>
JDO supports (in Java&nbsp; standard, there are other tools like it) an
object-oriented way to describe data and deal with it, and make objects
persistent<br>
</div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Database layer<br>
</span></h2>
design status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">a pretty straightforward API for
accessing MDD-generated tables in a database-neutral manner<br>
the Dictionary usage for data arguments is a bit heavy (needs casts, is
not type-safe, etc)<br>
maybe Database should be really called Transaction, or Connection<br>
</div>
design still not finished for:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">uncertainty about object-orientation
(see MDD)<br>
</div>
implementation status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">old, trusted code, using JDBC 1<br>
</div>
3rd-party tools and standards: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">database-neutrality made lots of
progress in the past years. JDO, JDBC Connector, even JDBC itself&nbsp;
do much better then they used to. dropping the db layer for one of
these technologies could be very beneficial<br>
the JDBC API (currently at version 3 and going towards version 4) made
lots of progress since JDBC 1, most probably there are loads of
features that makumba does not take advantage of, including e.g. Rowsets<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">OQL<br>
</span></h2>
design status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">specify queries in a database-neutral
manner. but this can increasingly be done in simple, standard SQL.<br>
we borrowed OQL (object query language)
from the now defunct ODMG. the initial version of their OQL grammar is
still on the makumba CVS. <br>
the ambition was to be object-oriented (see MDD)<br>
an important feature of makumba OQL that distinguishes it from SQL is
the ability to refer sets easily (FROM general.Person p, p.addresses a
... instead of FROM general.Person p, general.Person-&gt;addresses a
WHERE a.person=p, though the second form should also work)<br>
another important feature is the ability to analyze queries, including
type checking, useful during page analysis. even if we adopt a thrid
party technology, some form of query parsing will still be needed.<br>
</div>
design still not finished for:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">functions. they should probably keep
the object oriented manner (object.call(arguments) )<br>
</div>
implementation status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">subqueries are badly missed<br>
patchy, hard to add new features. one should start fresh from the
original OQL grammar and reimplement it to add functions and subqueries<br>
</div>
3rd-party tools and standards: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">database-neutrality made lots of
progress in the past years. JDO (which has its own form of OQL), JDBC
Connector, even JDBC itself&nbsp; do
much better then they used to. dropping or adapting OQL for one of
these
technologies could be very beneficial. JDO is explicitely recommended
by ODMG as the natural place to go<br>
</div>
<h2>Login</h2>
design status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">based on "secret attributes". <br>
the design was so poor that it had to be patched with "checkAttributes".<br>
the design led to a number of problems, including secret attributes
with identical names in different parts of the site<br>
the design also hides the concept of session, which is important to
learn (and use) for developers. sessions can be used for more than login<br>
</div>
3rd-party tools: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">the servlet speficication itself has a
good login design, and that standard login (and the design of its
integration in makumba) should be looked at first<br>
there are other tools like jSai that seem to work in this department<br>
</div>
<br>
<h2>"Business Logic"<br>
</h2>
design status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">bad design, mixture between logic and
controller.<br>
thus the "clean MVC" part of the statement of purpose is still not well
addressed<br>
it's clear that business rules should live with the data, maybe in MDD
files, maybe near them. <br>
parts that are more dependent on the interface (on the way the form was
shown, etc) should be part of the controller<br>
</div>
design still not finished for:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">i think this part should be completely
restructured. <br>
stuff that does pure data processing should move to "data model"<br>
stuff that does data adaptation from and to the dialogs (forms) should
go to the controller<br>
sessions should be visible to the model, the controller, or both <br>
</div>
3rd-party tools: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Jakarta Struts, JSF, EJB (e.g. for
session design)<br>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Controller<br>
</h2>
design status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">transparent for now. executes at every
page access, via a servlet filter<br>
</div>
design still not finished for:
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">see "business logic": stuff that's
specific to the form should be specified in/near the JSP and executed
by the controller<br>
not able to show different pages after form submission<br>
in general, not enough flexibility in treating the errors<br>
</div>
3rd-party tools: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Jakarta Struts, JSF<br>
</div>
<h2>Developer tools<br>
</h2>
design status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">pretty original, building on the
originality of MDD and JSP parts<br>
</div>
design still not finished for:
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;interacting more with the
programming during development<br>
</div>
implementation status:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"page summary" is still not
implemented, although the recent page analysis code makes it much easier<br>
</div>
3rd-party tools: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Ant<br>
Eclipse<br>
