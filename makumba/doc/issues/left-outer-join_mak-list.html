<h1>Left outer join embedded mak:lists</h1>
Currently each mak:list is generating a query. If two mak:.lists are
embedded, they generate two queries whose results are then combined
(grouped) inside Makumba (i.e. not in the DB, so this is a bit of a
performance penalty)<br>
<pre>&lt;mak:list from="A a, B b" ...&gt;                -----&gt; SELECT ... FROM A a, B b<br>	&lt;mak:list from="C c, D d" ...&gt;        -----&gt; SELECT ... FROM A a, B b, C c, D d<br>	...<br>	&lt;/mak:list&gt;<br>&lt;/mak:list&gt;<br></pre>
<br>
If the two queries are joined simply (i.e. if only the second query
above would be used), the results of
the outer mak:list (a,b) that have no corresponding results in the
inner
mak:list (c or d) will not show up. For them to show up, a left outer
join is
needed. Such a join was not possible in mysql before. Once the left
outer join is possible, a single-query implementation of
embedded mak:lists should be possible, but Makumba's code still uses
the simpler technique. <br>
<br>
Another issue that introduces more queries is the join over a nullable
pointer.<br>
<pre>&lt;mak:list from="A a" ...&gt;                            -----------&gt; SELECT ... FROM A a<br>	&lt;mak:value expr="a.nullablePtr.field" &gt;      -----------&gt; SELECT a.nullablePtr.field FROM A a<br>&lt;/mak:list&gt;<br></pre>
If only the second query would be executed, the a's that have
nullablePtr null will not show up. That's why the nullable field needs
a query of its own. (So the actual total number of queries is <br>
<pre>	numberOfMakLists+ numberOfNullablePointersUsed</pre>
Potential advantages of the left join: <br>
<ul>
  <li>may simplify the iteration code</li>
  <li>higher performance by elimination of resultset grouping<br>
  </li>
  <li>less database hits</li>
  <li>no risk for data inconsistency due to changes made to the db in
between queries<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Brief:<br>
<ul>
  <li>think how the left outer join would look like. Probably in the
example both C and D will need to be joined so?&nbsp; Or just C??? Look
at DB theory.<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <pre>SELECT ... FROM A a JOIN B b LEFT JOIN C c LEFT JOIN D d</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>think how the present grouping will be taken away, and how
mak:list can be re-implemented to loop through the outer-join query
results instead of the former org.makumba.view.Grouper</li>
  <li>consider how to use left join for nullable pointers
(straightforward I guess)<br>
  </li>
  <li>consider the problem of DISTINCT. If one query is used, it will
force all mak:lists to DISTINCT. is this acceptable? Currently mak:list
distinct="true" is not implemented anyway, but do consider how this
would affect it.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
