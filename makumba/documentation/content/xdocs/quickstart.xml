      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>This guide will help you getting started with Makumba. It explains the notion of Makumba
      Data Definitions, and shows you how to make a simple site where you can display and create data.</p>
      <p>We'll take the example of a company management site, where you can manage the employees,
        departments and projects of a company.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="download">
      <title>Download</title>
        <p>First of all, <a href="site:download">download</a> the Makumba template project in order to get an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/">Eclipse WTP project</a> which you can use in order to start working with Makumba.</p>
        <p>You'll also need to download <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi">Apache
          Tomcat 5.5</a> and configure a WTP Server (in Eclipse, go to File -> New -> Other and
          choose "Server").</p>
      <p>Optionally, you can also download <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html">MySQL</a> as a database engine. For this introduction however, the template project comes with the <a href="http://hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</a> database engine, so you don't need to install anything in that regard.</p>

    <section id="MDD">
      <title>Describing the data</title>
      <p>Makumba uses so-called Makumba Data Definitions (further described <a href="site:model">here</a>).</p>
      <p>MDDs are simple text files that contain the description of an entity, i.e. its fields but also validation rules and query functions. These files are kept in the <code>dataDefinitions</code> directory in the classpath of the webapp.</p>
      <p>Start by creating a new <code>company</code> package in the <code>src/dataDefinitions</code> directory and create the file <code>Employee.mdd</code> with the following content</p>
      <source><![CDATA[name = char[200]
surname = char[200]
gender = int{"Male" = 10, "Female" = 20}
birthdate = date
salary = real ]]></source>
    </section>
    <p>This will make the type <code>company.Employee</code> accessible in the webapp.</p>
    <note>Makumba automatically generates the database schema based on MDDs. If you modify a MDD, you will need to reload your webapp for the changes to be taken into account.</note>
    
    <section id="create">
      <title>Entering new data</title>
      <p>Let's make it possible to feed some data to our webapp.</p>
      <p>For this, let's create a page that contains a mak:newForm, which enables us to enter new data. Create the file <code>WebContent/employeeNew.jsp</code> with following content:</p>
      <source><![CDATA[<%@ taglib uri="http://www.makumba.org/presentation" prefix="mak" %>
<html>
<head>
<title>Create new employee record</title>
</head>
<body>

<mak:newForm type="company.Employee" method="post" action="index.jsp">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <td><mak:input field="name" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Surname</th>
      <td><mak:input field="surname" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Birthdate</th>
      <td><mak:input field="birthdate" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Salary</th>
      <td><mak:input field="salary" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><input type="submit" value="Add"> <input type="reset" value="Cancel" onClick="javascript:back();"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</mak:newForm>

</body>
