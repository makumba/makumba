      <p>To cancel out a certain attribute, in order to produce a new login, the logout tag is available
You can remove (cancel-out, logout) multiple attributes from the session by using &amp;lt;mak:logout actor="attribute name"&amp;gt; several times and/or by using the star (*) wildcard, e.g.:
(Later on, logout request might be done in the business logic, with a method deleteAttributes(param) that can accept either a String (with optional '*') or a String[]. ) 
(Later: to accomodate servers that don't do session tracking, login can be done by a query condition rather than by doing a query (once per session) to find an attribute. This way, it won't need to do a query (to check the authentication) at every access, but that condition will make sure that authentication is done. )

(&amp;lt;mak:object from="best.Student stud" where ="stud.$login()"&amp;gt; ...&lt;/mak:object&gt; 
then methodBestSudentLogin("stud") will return "stud.auth.email=$username AND stud.auth.password=$password" 
This can be used for http authentication with no session tracking. )
(Later: if an attribute has multiple values, a choose{AttributeName}.jsp page is shown. For example, a super user (for that area) can choose to act as any student, Lbg, or company... A student member of more local Vivaldi teams can choose to act for any of the viv teams, etc. )
